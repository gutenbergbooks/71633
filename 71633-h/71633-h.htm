<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<small>AT THE LITTLE BLUE SHOP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A bell tinkled as the door of the little blue
shop opened and closed, and continued to
tinkle, although decreasingly, as the stout
youth who had entered turned unhesitatingly but
with a kind of impressive dignity toward where
in the dimmer light of the store a recently installed
soda-fountain, modest of size but brave
with white marble and nickel, gleamed a welcome.</p>

<p>In response to the summons of the bell a girl
came through the door that led to the rear of the
little building. As she came she fastened a long
apron over the dark blue dress and sent an inquiring
hand upward to the smooth brown hair.
Evidently reassured, she said, “Hello,” in a
friendly voice and, having established herself behind
the counter, looked questioningly at the customer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>“Hello,” responded the boy. “Give me a
chocolate sundae with walnuts and a slice of pineapple,
please. And you might put a couple of
cherries on top. Seen Nod this afternoon?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head as she deposited a portion
of ice-cream in a dish and pressed the
nickeled disk marked “Chocolate.” “I’ve just
this minute got back from school,” she replied.
“Aren’t you out early to-day?”</p>

<p>“No recitation last hour,” the youth explained
as his eyes followed her movements fascinatedly.
“That all the chopped walnuts I get,
Polly?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is when you ask for pineapple and
cherries, too,” answered the girl firmly. She
tucked a small spoon on the side of the alarming
concoction, laid a paper napkin in front of the
customer, and placed the dish beside it. “Would
you like a glass of water?”</p>

<p>The youth paused in raising the first spoonful
to his mouth and looked to see if she spoke with
sarcasm. Apparently, however, she did not, and
so he said, “Yes, please,” or most of it; the last
of it was decidedly unintelligible, proceeding as
it did from behind a mouthful of ice-cream, chocolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
syrup, and cherry. When the glass of water
had been added to the array before him and he
had swallowed three spoonfuls of the satisfying
medley, the stout youth sighed deeply, and his
gaze went roaming to an appealing display of
pastry beyond the girl.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have a cream-cake,” he announced.
“And one of those tarts, please. What’s in ’em,
Polly?”</p>

<p>“Raspberry jam.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. All right. Better make it two,
then.”</p>

<p>Polly Deane eyed him severely. “Kewpie
Proudtree,” she exclaimed, “you know you
oughtn’t to eat all this sweet stuff!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the difference?” demanded the
youth morosely. “Gee, a fellow can’t starve all
the time! Maybe I won’t go in for football next
year, anyway. It’s a dog’s life. No desserts
you can eat, no candy, no—”</p>

<p>“Well, I think that’s a very funny way for
you to talk,” interrupted Polly indignantly.
“After the way you played in the Farview game
and everything! Why, every one said you were
just wonderful, Kewpie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Kewpie’s gloom was momentarily dissipated,
giving place to an expression of gratification.
He hastily elevated a portion of ice-cream to his
mouth and murmured deprecatingly, “Oh, well,
but—”</p>

<p>“And you know perfectly well,” continued the
girl, “that pastry and sweets make you fat, and
Mr. Mulford won’t like it a bit, and—”</p>

<p>It was Kewpie’s turn to interrupt, and he did
it vigorously. “What of it?” he demanded. “I
don’t have to stay fat, do I? I’ve got all summer
to train down again, haven’t I? Gee, Polly,
what’s the use of starving all the winter and
spring just to play football for a couple of months
next fall? Other fellows don’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Kewpie, you know very well that most
of them do! You don’t see Ned and Laurie eating
pastry here every afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Huh, that’s a lot different. Nod’s out for
baseball, and Nid’s scared to do anything Nod
doesn’t do. Why, gee, if one of those twins
broke his leg the other’d go and bust his! I
never saw anything so—so disgusting. Say,
don’t I get those tarts?”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly won’t if you talk like that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
about your best friends,” answered Polly crisply.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I didn’t say anything,” muttered
Kewpie, grinning. “Those fellows are different,
and you know it. Gee, if I was on the baseball
team I’d let pastry alone, too, I guess. It stands
to reason. You understand. But it doesn’t
make any difference to any one what I do. They
wouldn’t let me play basket-ball, and when I
wanted to try for goal-tend on the hockey-team
Scoville said it wouldn’t be fair to the other teams
to hide the net entirely. Smart Aleck! Besides,
I’m only a hundred and sixty-one pounds right
now.”</p>

<p>“That’s more than you were in the fall, I’m
certain,” said Polly severely.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Kewpie. “Gee, when I came
out of the Farview game I was down to a hundred
and fifty-one and a half! I guess my normal
weight’s about a hundred and sixty-five,” he
added comfortably. “What about those tarts
and the cream-cake?”</p>

<p>“You may have the cream-cake and one tart,
and that’s all. I oughtn’t to let you have either.
Laurie says—”</p>

<p>“Huh, he says a lot of things,” grunted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Kewpie, setting his teeth into the crisp flakiness
of the tart. “And I notice that what he says is
mighty important around here, too.” Kewpie
smiled slyly, and Polly’s cheeks warmed slightly.
“Anything Nod says or does is all right, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What Laurie says is certainly a lot more
important than what you say, Mr. Proudtree,”
replied Polly warmly, “and—”</p>

<p>“Now, say,” begged Kewpie, “I didn’t mean
to be fresh, honest Polly! Gee, if you’re going
to call me ‘Mister Proudtree’ I won’t ever—ever—”</p>

<p>He couldn’t seem to decide what it was he
wouldn’t ever do, and so he thrust the last of the
tart into his mouth and looked hurt and reproachful.
When Kewpie looked that way no one, least
of all the soft-hearted Polly, could remain offended.
Polly’s haughtiness vanished, and she
smiled. Finally she laughed merrily, and
Kewpie’s face cleared instantly.</p>

<p>“Kewpie,” said Polly, “you’re perfectly
silly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m just a nut,” agreed the boy cheerfully.
“Well, I guess I’ll go over to the field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and see what’s doing. If you see Nod tell him
I’m looking for him, will you?”</p>

<p>Polly looked after him concernedly. Something
was wrong with Kewpie. He seemed
gloomy and almost—almost reckless! Of late he
had rioted in sweets and the stickiest of fountain
mixtures, which was not like him. She wondered
if he had a secret sorrow, and decided to
speak to Laurie and Ned about him.</p>

<p>Polly Deane was rather pretty, with an oval
face not guiltless of freckles, brown hair and
brown eyes and a nice smile. She was not quite
sixteen years old. Polly’s mother—known to the
boys of Hillman’s School as the “Widow”—kept
the little blue-painted shop, and Polly, when not
attending the Orstead High School, helped her.
The shop occupied the front room on the ground
floor. Behind it was a combined kitchen, dining
and living room, and up-stairs were two sleeping
chambers. Mrs. Deane could have afforded
a more luxurious home, but she liked her modest
business and often declared that she didn’t know
where she’d find a place more comfortable.</p>

<p>Polly was aroused from her concern over the
recent customer by the abrupt realization that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
he had forgotten to pay for his entertainment.
She sighed. Kewpie already owed more than the
school rules allowed. Just then the door opened
to admit a slim, round-faced boy of about Polly’s
age. He had red-brown hair under his blue
school cap, an impertinent nose, and very blue
eyes. He wore a suit of gray, with a dark-blue
sweater beneath the coat. He wore, also, a cheerful
and contagious smile.</p>

<p>“Hello, Polly,” was his greeting. “Laurie
been in yet?”</p>

<p>“No, no one but Kewpie, Ned. He was looking
for Laurie, too. He’s just gone.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know where the silly hombre’s
got to,” said the new-comer. “He was in class
five minutes ago, and then he disappeared.
Thought he’d be over here. I’d like a chocolate
ice-cream soda, please. Say, don’t you hate this
kind of weather? No ice and the ground too wet
to do anything on. Funny weather you folks have
here in the East.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t be this way long,” answered
Polly as she filled his order. “The ground will
be dry in a day or two, if it doesn’t rain—or snow
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“Snow again!” exclaimed the other. “Gee-all-whillikens,
does it snow all summer here?”</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes we have a snow in April,
Ned, and this is only the twenty-first of March.
But when spring does come it’s beautiful. I just
love the spring, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Reckon so. I like our springs back home, but
I don’t know what your Eastern springs are like
yet.” He dipped into his soda and nodded approvingly.
“Say, Polly, you certainly can mix
’em. Congreve’s has got nothing on you. Talking
about spring, back in California—”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the opening of the door.
The new arrival was a slim, round-faced youth of
about Polly’s age. He had reddish-brown hair
under the funny little blue cap he wore, a somewhat
impertinent nose, and very blue eyes. He
wore a suit of gray knickers with coat to match
and a dark blue sweater beneath the coat. Also,
he wore a most cheerful smile. The first arrival
turned and, with spoon suspended, viewed him
sternly.</p>

<p>“I bid you say where you have been,” he demanded.</p>

<p>The new-comer threw forth his right hand, palm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
upward, and poised himself on the toes of his
wet shoes like a ballet-dancer.</p>

<p>“In search of you, my noble twin,” he answered
promptly. “Hello, Polly!”</p>

<p>“Punk!” growled Ned Turner. “‘Been’ and
‘twin’! My eye!”</p>

<p>“Perfectly allowable rime, old son. What are
you having?”</p>

<p>“Chocolate ice-cream soda. Say, what became
of you after school? I looked all over for you.”</p>

<p>“Ran up to the room a minute. Thought
you’d wait, you dumb-bell.”</p>

<p>“I did wait. Then I thought you’d started
over here. Whose wheel is that you’ve got out
there?”</p>

<p>“Search me. Elk Thurston’s, I guess. I
found it doing nothing in front of West. I’ll
take a pineapple and strawberry, please, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Well, you had a nerve! Elk will scalp you.”</p>

<p>Laurie shrugged and accepted his refreshment.
“I only borrowed it,” he explained carelessly.
“Here comes the mob.”</p>

<p>The afternoon influx of Hillman’s boys was begun
by two tousled-haired juniors demanding
“Vanilla sundaes with chopped walnuts, please,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Miss Polly!” and after them the stream became
steady for several minutes. Further sustained
conversation with Polly being no longer possible,
Ned and Laurie took their glasses to the other
side of the shop, where Laurie perched himself
on the counter and watched the confusion. Ned’s
eyes presently strayed to the array of pastry behind
the further counter, and he sighed wistfully.
But as Laurie, who was in training for baseball,
might not partake of such things, Ned resolutely
removed his gaze from that part of the shop, not
without a second sigh, and, turning it to the door,
nudged Laurie in the ribs with an elbow.</p>

<p>“Thurston,” he breathed.</p>

<p>Laurie looked calmly at the big upper-middle
boy who was entering. “Seems put out about
something,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Say,” demanded “Elk” Thurston in a voice
that dominated the noise of talk and laughter and
the almost continuous <em>hiss</em> of the soda-fountain,
“what smart guy swiped my bicycle and rode it
over here?”</p>

<p>Elkins Thurston was seventeen, big, dark-complexioned,
and domineering, and as the chatter
died into comparative silence the smaller boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
questioned each other with uneasy glances. No
one, however, confessed, and Elk, pushing his way
roughly toward the fountain, complained bitterly.
“Well, some fresh Aleck did, and I’ll find out
who he was, too, and when I do I’ll teach him to
let my things alone!”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Elk?” asked Laurie
politely. Ned, nudging him to keep still, found
Elk observing him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“You heard, I guess,” answered Elk. “Did
you have it?”</p>

<p>“Me?” said Ned. “No, I didn’t have it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean you; I mean him.” Elk pointed
an accusing finger at Laurie.</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Laurie. “What was it you
lost?”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” whispered Ned. “He’ll come over
and—”</p>

<p>“My bicycle, that’s what! I’ll bet you swiped
it, you fresh kid.”</p>

<p>“What’s it look like?” inquired Laurie interestedly.</p>

<p>“Never you mind.” Elk strode across, fixing
Laurie with angry eyes. “Say, you took it,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“Must have,” said Laurie cheerfully. “Did
you want it?”</p>

<p>“Did I—did I want— Say, for two pins I’d—”</p>

<p>“But, my dear old chap, how was I to know
that you’d be wanting to ride it?” asked Laurie
earnestly. “There it was, leaning against the
steps, not earning its keep, and you hadn’t said
a thing to me about wanting it, and so I just
simply borrowed it. Honest, Elk, if you’d so
much as hinted to me, never so delicately, that—”</p>

<p>There were titters from the younger members
of the much interested audience and even unconcealed
laughter from the older boys, and Elk’s
dark countenance took on a deeper and more
angry red as he thrust it close to Laurie’s.</p>

<p>“That’ll be about all for you,” he growled.
“You’re one of these funny guys, aren’t you?
Must have your little joke, eh? Well, see how
you like this one!”</p>

<p>Elk raised his right hand, unclenched but formidable.
An expectant hush filled the little store.
Polly, with troubled eyes fixed on the drama, deluged
a pineapple ice-cream with soda until it
dripped on the counter below. Laurie continued
to smile.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<small>KEWPIE STATES HIS CASE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Whatever’s going on?” asked a pleasant
voice from the doorway that led into
the room behind the shop. “Is—is anything
wrong, Polly? Dear me, child, you’re running
that all over the counter!”</p>

<p>More than two dozen pairs of eyes turned to
where Mrs. Deane looked perplexedly about her.
She was a sweet-faced little woman whose white
hair was contradicted by a plump, unlined countenance
and rosy cheeks. Elk’s uplifted arm
dropped slowly back. For a short moment the
silence continued. Then a veritable Babel of
voices arose. “Hello, Mrs. Deane!” “Say,
Mrs. Deane, don’t you remember me paying you
ten cents last Friday? Miss Polly says I still
owe—” “Mrs. Deane, when are you going to
have some more of those twirly things with the
cream filling?” “Mrs. Deane, will you wait on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
me, please? I want—” “Aw, I was ahead of
him—”</p>

<p>The Widow Deane beamed and made her way to
the rear of the counter, greeting the boys by name.
She was fond of all boys, but those of Hillman’s
School she looked on as peculiarly her own, and
she knew the names of nearly every one of them
and, to a remarkable extent, their taste in the matter
of pastry and beverages. “I couldn’t imagine
what had happened,” she was explaining to Cas
Bennett as she filled his order for two apple turnovers.
“All of a sudden everything became so
still in here! What was it?”</p>

<p>Cas grinned. “Oh, just some of Nod Turner’s
foolishness,” he replied evasively. “He and
Thurston were—were talking.”</p>

<p>They were still talking, for that matter, although
their fickle audience no longer heeded.
The interruption had quite spoiled Elk’s great
scene, and after lowering his arm he had not
raised it again. Even he realized that you
couldn’t start anything when Mrs. Deane was
present. But he was still angry and was explaining
to Laurie none too elegantly that vengeance
was merely postponed and not canceled. Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
maintaining outward neutrality, watched Elk very
closely. Ned had an idea, perhaps a mistaken
one, that when it came to fistic encounters it was
his bounden duty to substitute for Laurie, and
he had been on the point of substituting when
Mrs. Deane’s appearance had called a halt.</p>

<p>Laurie’s smile gave place to sudden gravity as
he interrupted Elk’s flow of eloquence. “That
will do,” he said. “I’m not afraid of you,
Thurston, but it’s silly to get so upset over a
trifle. Of course I shouldn’t have taken your
wheel, but I didn’t hurt it any, and you’ve
bawled me out quite enough, don’t you think?
I’ll apologize, if you like, and—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your apology,” growled Elk.
“You’re too blamed fresh, Turner, and you talk
too much. After this you let everything of mine
alone. If you don’t, I’ll do what I was going to
do when the old lady came in. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” replied Laurie soberly. “Have
a soda?”</p>

<p>“Not with you, you little shrimp!” Elk strode
away, fuming, to elbow his way to the fountain.</p>

<p>“What did you have to say that for?” asked
Ned. “You had him pretty nearly calmed down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and then you had to spoil it all by offering him a
drink. When he said you talk too much he was
dead right!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, what’s he want to kick up such a fuss
for?” asked Laurie cheerfully. “Come on.
I’ve got to beat it to gym for practice.”</p>

<p>They waved a farewell to Polly over the heads
and shoulders of the throng about the fountain,
but that young lady demanded speech with them
and left her duties for a hasty word nearer the
door. “I’ve just got to see you boys about
Kewpie,” she announced. “It’s very important.
Can’t you come back a minute before supper,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“Kewpie?” asked Laurie. “What’s wrong
with him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. That’s what I want to talk
about. There isn’t time now.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll be back about five thirty,”
agreed Ned. “By. See you later.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s up,” said Laurie when, having
reached School Park, they turned their steps
briskly over the slushy pavements toward Hillman’s.
“Looked perfectly normal last time I
saw him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Kewpie? Sure, all except his size. That’s
not normal. By the way, he was looking for you,
Polly said. Matter of life or death.”</p>

<p>“Huh, I know what he wants. He’s got it into
that crazy head of his that he can pitch, and he
wants me to give him a try-out. I sort of half
promised I would.”</p>

<p>“Mean he wants to pitch for the nine?” asked
Ned incredulously.</p>

<p>“Well, he wants to get on the squad, anyway.
Thinks that if I tell Mr. Mulford he’s sort of
good, Pinky will take him on.”</p>

<p>“Would he?”</p>

<p>Laurie shrugged. “I don’t believe. Mulford
warned the fellows two weeks back that if
they didn’t report for indoor work he didn’t
want them later. And he generally keeps his
word, Pinky does.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Kewpie think of it before?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Search me, old dear. What’s troubling me
is that he’s thought of it now. He’s been pestering
the life out of me for a week.”</p>

<p>“What’s he want you to look him over for?
Why doesn’t he ask Cas Bennett or some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
one who knows something about pitching?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he knows they wouldn’t bother with
him. Thinks because Pinky’s got it into his old
bean that he can make a catcher of me that I can
spot a Mathewson or a Mays with my eyes shut.
I appreciate his faith in me and all that, Ned, and
it wounds me sorely that my own kith and kin—meaning
you, old dear—haven’t the same—er—boundless
trust in my ability, but, just between
the two of us, I don’t know a curve from a drop
yet, and if I can stop one with my mitt I’m as
pleased as anything and don’t care a continental
whether the silly thing stays in said mitt or
doesn’t. Frankly, I’m plumb convinced that
Pinky had a brain-storm when he dragged me in
from the outfield and stuck me behind a wire bird-cage!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he knows his business,” responded
Ned. “Anyhow, you’ve got to do your best. If
you don’t I’ll lick the daylight out of you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean <em>into</em> me?” asked Laurie
sweetly. “Seems to me that ought to be the
proper phrase. Having, as I understand physiology,
no daylight in me, to start with—”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! I mean what I say, though. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
agreed when we got here last fall that I was to
go in for football and you for baseball. I know
I didn’t make very good—”</p>

<p>“Shut up yourself! You did so!”</p>

<p>“But that’s the more reason you should. The
honor of the Turners is at stake, partner. Don’t
you forget that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do my best,” sighed Laurie, “but I
certainly do hold it ag’in Pinky for butting in on
my quiet, peaceful life out in the field and talking
me into this catching stuff. Gosh, I had no
idea the human hand could propel a ball through
space, as it were, the way those pitcher guys do!
Some time I’ll break a couple of fingers, I suppose,
and then I’ll get let out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t,” said Ned grimly. “All
the big league catchers have two or three broken
fingers on each hand. Don’t count on that, old
son!”</p>

<p>They had crossed Walnut Street now and were
stamping the melted snow from their shoes on the
drier concrete sidewalk before the school property.
Above the top of a privet hedge the upper
stories of the school buildings were in sight, West
Hall, School Hall, and East Hall facing Summit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Street in order. In the windows of West Hall,
a dormitory, gaily hued cushions added color to
the monotony of the brick edifice, and here and
there an upthrown casement allowed a white sash-curtain
to wave lazily in the breeze of a mild
March afternoon. As the two boys turned in at
the first gate, under the modest sign announcing
“Hillman’s School—Entrance Only,” Laurie
broke the short silence.</p>

<p>“What are you doing this afternoon?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There isn’t much a fellow can
do except read.”</p>

<p>“Or study,” supplemented Laurie virtuously.
“Better come along and watch practice a
while.”</p>

<p>But Ned shook his head. “Not good enough,
old-timer. That baseball cage is too stuffy.
Guess I’ll wander over to the field and see if
there’s anything going on.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be. They say the ice has gone to
mush. Listen. If you see Kewpie, tell him I
died suddenly, will you? And how about Polly?
Shall I meet you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, five thirty we told her. So-long!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“By, old dear! Here’s where I go and lose
a finger!”</p>

<p>Ned climbed to the second floor of East Hall and
made his way along the corridor to No. 16. The
door was ajar, and when he had pushed it open
he discovered Kewpie Proudtree stretched at
length on the window-seat. It was no unusual
thing to find Kewpie in possession of No. 16, for
he appeared to like it fully as well as his own
quarters across the way, if not better. Kewpie
laid down the magazine he had been examining
and laboriously pulled himself to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nid,” he greeted. “Where’s Nod?”
It was Kewpie who had tagged those quaint nicknames
on the Turner twins, and he never failed
to use them.</p>

<p>“Gym,” answered Ned. “Practice.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em> What time is it? And here I’ve been
wasting my time waiting for him!”</p>

<p>“Too bad about your time! Get your cap, and
let’s go over to the field.”</p>

<p>But Kewpie shook his head sadly, relapsing
against the cushions. “I’m not feeling very well,
Nid,” he said plaintively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Ned looked at him with more interest, wondering
if it could be Kewpie’s state of health that
was concerning Polly Deane. But it was difficult
to associate that youth’s bulk with illness, and
Ned abandoned the idea. “What’s wrong with
you?” he inquired jeeringly.</p>

<p>“It seems to be my stomach,” said Kewpie, laying
a sympathetic hand on that portion of his
anatomy.</p>

<p>“Does, eh? Well, what have you been eating?”</p>

<p>“Eating? Nothing much. Well, I did have a
cream-puff and a tart at the Widow’s, but I guess
it isn’t that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not, you silly prune! And
you probably had a nut sundae with whipped
cream and sliced peaches and a lot of other
truck on it. Funny you don’t feel well, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have any whipped cream,” said
Kewpie indignantly. “It—it makes me bilious.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on over to the field. It’ll do you
good.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been there. There’s nothing doing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Nid. The rink looks like tapioca pudding, and
you can go in to your ankles anywhere you walk.
Look at my shoes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and look at that window-seat, you crazy
galoot! Why don’t you wipe your dirty feet on
your own cushions?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll come off.” Kewpie flicked at the
muddy stains with a nonchalant hand. “Say,
listen. I’ve been trying to get hold of Nod all
day. How long’s he going to practise?”</p>

<p>“Search me. They keep at it until five or a
bit after, I think. What you got on your so-called
mind, Kewpie?”</p>

<p>Kewpie hesitated and finally decided to take
Ned into his confidence. “Well, it’s like this,”
he began impressively. “A fellow needs more
exercise than he gets along this time of year, Nid.
Of course, it’s all right for you fellows who play
basket-ball or hockey, but I couldn’t get into
those things, and there isn’t much else to keep
you fit. Now—”</p>

<p>“Except pastry at the Widow Deane’s,
Kewpie.”</p>

<p>Kewpie ignored the interruption. “Well, anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
I’ve been thinking that if I could get into
baseball it would be a mighty good thing for me.
Sort of keep me in training, you know. I—I’m
likely to put on weight if I don’t watch out. You
understand.”</p>

<p>“What’s your line?” asked Ned innocently.
“Short-stop?”</p>

<p>Kewpie grinned. “Pitcher,” he said.</p>

<p>“Really? Why, I didn’t know you were a
baseball pitcher. Ever worked at it much?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Kewpie. Then his gaze wavered
and he hedged a trifle. “Of course, I’ve never
tried for the team or anything like that, but last
spring we had a scrub team here and I pitched on
it—generally. I’ve got something, too, let me
tell you.” Kewpie’s assurance returned. “All
I need is practice, Nid. Why, I can pitch a drop
that’s a wonder!”</p>

<p>“Too bad you didn’t go out for the team this
year,” said Ned. “I understand Mr. Mulford
won’t take any fellows on who didn’t report
early.”</p>

<p>Kewpie’s dejection returned and he nodded.
“I know,” he answered. “That’s why I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to get Nod to—to sort of speak a good word for
me. You see, if I can show him I’ve got something
on the ball and he tells Pinky, why, I guess
Pinky wouldn’t want to lose me.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you speak to Pinky yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know how coaches are. They don’t
believe what you tell ’em half the time; think
you’re just stringing ’em to get on the squad.”</p>

<p>“And, of course, you wouldn’t do that,” said
Ned gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” answered Kewpie, grinning.
“You don’t think I can pitch, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“You win,” replied Ned simply.</p>

<p>“All right, then, I’ll show you, by Joshua!
You get Nod to catch me, and you’ll see. Honest,
you might help a fellow, Nid, instead of joshing
him. Why, say, look how I got you on the football
team last fall! If I hadn’t told Joe Stevenson
about you being a star half-back—”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you came mighty close to getting
your silly dome knocked clean off you,” interrupted
Ned grimly. “A nice bunch of trouble
you got me into!”</p>

<p>“Well, it came out all right, didn’t it?” asked
Kewpie irrepressibly. “Didn’t you win the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
game for us with that kick of yours? Sure, you
did! I’ll say so!”</p>

<p>“Never you mind about that, old son. If you
expect me to help you get on the baseball team
you needn’t crack up what you did last fall!”</p>

<p>Kewpie looked momentarily pained, but perhaps
he was accustomed to the ingratitude of
human nature. Anyway, he arose with careful
deliberation from the window-seat, an inquiring
palm laid against his stomach, and smiled forgivingly
down on Ned. “Well, I’ve got to be going
back,” he announced. “Tell Nod I’ll be in
about six, won’t you? And—er—say, you don’t
happen to have a half-dollar you don’t need right
away, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I might,” answered Ned, reaching into a
pocket. “Going to bribe your way into baseball,
you fat rascal?”</p>

<p>“No, but I went off without paying for the
stuff at the Widow’s, Nid; clean forgot all about
it, and—”</p>

<p>“Kewpie, don’t lie, or you won’t get this!”</p>

<p>Kewpie grinned. “Well, I didn’t exactly <em>forget</em>
it, maybe, but it—it sort of passed out of my
mind at the moment. You understand. I really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
ought to go back there and pay it, Nid.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I can save you the trouble.
I’m going down there myself pretty soon. How
much is it?”</p>

<p>“Twenty cents,” faltered Kewpie.</p>

<p>“Fine! Then you won’t need the other thirty,
old son.”</p>

<p>There was deep reproach in Kewpie’s face as
he went out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>THE “A. R. K. P.” IS FORMED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Few customers patronized the little blue shop
on Pine Street between five and six. Hillman’s
discouraged the consumption of sweets so
close to the school supper-hour, and, while there
was no rule against it, the fellows felt themselves
more or less on honor to observe the doctor’s frequently
expressed wish. Neighbors ran in at intervals
for a loaf of bread or cake or ten cents’
worth of whipped cream, but for the most part,
as six o’clock approached, the bell tinkled infrequently.
Consequently the conference held this
afternoon in the Widow Deane’s sitting-room,
which was also kitchen and dining-room and parlor,
was almost undisturbed. The conference
was participated in by four persons, Polly, Ned,
Laurie, and Mae Ferrand. Mae’s presence had
been unforeseen, but as she was Polly’s particular
chum and, as Laurie phrased it, “one of the
bunch,” it occasioned no embarrassment. Mae<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
was about Polly’s age and perhaps a bit prettier,
although, to quote Laurie again, it all depended
on whether you liked light hair or dark. Mae’s
hair was pure sunshine, and her skin was milk-white
and rose-pink; and, which aroused Polly’s
envy, she never freckled.</p>

<p>As the four had known each other since autumn
there was no stiffness apparent in either speech
or action. Ned lolled back in the comfortable old
patent rocker, with his legs over one arm of it,
and Laurie swung his feet from the table, secure
in the knowledge that Polly’s mother was up-stairs.
Laurie had a weakness for positions allowing
him full liberty for his feet. Polly was
talking. She and Mae, arms entwined, occupied
the couch between the windows. A shining kettle
on the stove hissed cozily, and a big black cat,
Towser by name, purred in Ned’s lap as he
scratched her head.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong with him,” stated
Polly convincedly. “I’ve noticed it for quite a
while, more than two weeks. He looks dreadfully
gloomy and unhappy, and he—he’s absent-minded,
too. Just this afternoon he went off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
without thinking a thing about paying for a sundae
and some cakes he had.”</p>

<p>Ned grinned but said nothing. Laurie winked
gravely.</p>

<p>“And that’s another thing,” continued Polly.
“It’s perfectly awful the way he eats sweet
things, Laurie. He comes in every day and, if
I’d let him, he’d make himself sick with cream-puffs
and tarts and candy. It just seems as if
he didn’t care what happened to him, as if he
was—was <em>desperate</em>! Why, he told me to-day
that maybe he wouldn’t play football any more!”</p>

<p>“I guess he was just talking,” said Mae.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.” Polly shook her head.
“He acts funny. Haven’t you noticed it,
Laurie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he always did act funny. He’s a
nut.”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t; he’s a real nice boy, and you
oughtn’t to talk like that. He’s unhappy, and
we ought to help him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Laurie cheerfully.
“What’ll we do?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose that first of all we should find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
out what’s worrying him,” answered Polly
thoughtfully. “You—you have to know the disease
before you apply the remedy.” Polly was
plainly rather pleased with that statement, and
so was Mae. Mae squeezed her friend’s arm in
token of appreciation. Laurie allowed that it
was a “wise crack” but wanted to know how
Polly proposed to make the discovery. “Far as
I can see,” he added, “Kewpie’s much the same
as usual, if not more so. Although, to tell the
honest gospel truth, I haven’t seen an awful lot
of him just recently. I’ve been sort of keeping
out of his way because he’s after me to see him
pitch so’s I can ask Pinky to let him on the baseball
squad.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be that, do you think?” asked
Polly of the room at large. “I mean, you don’t
suppose he’s hurt because you’ve been avoiding
him? He might think that you’d gone back on
him, Laurie, and I guess that Kewpie has a very
sensitive nature.”</p>

<p>Ned snorted. “Kewpie’s nature’s about as
sensitive as a—a whale’s!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about whales,” declared
Polly with dignity, “but I do know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
very often folks who don’t seem sensitive are
actually the very sensitivest of all. And I am
quite sure that if Kewpie thought Laurie had—had
deserted him—”</p>

<p>“Hey, hold hard, Polly! Gee, I haven’t deserted
the poor prune. I—I’ve been busy lately
and—and—well, that’s all there is to it. Gosh,
I like Kewpie. He’s all right, isn’t he, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Look here, Miss Chairwoman and
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Convention, the only
thing that’s wrong with Kewpie is that he
doesn’t know what to do with himself. Ever
since he stopped playing football he’s been like
a chap who’s lost his job and can’t find another
one. Of course, at first it wasn’t so bad, for
Christmas vacation was coming. But for the last
couple of months he’s just sort of mooned around,
getting sore-headed because he couldn’t make the
basket-ball team or the hockey team or anything
else. Give the old chap something to do and he’ll
snap out of it. He comes over here and fills up
on pastry and stuff because he hasn’t anything
better to do and has a sweet tooth, anyway.
Laurie and I have told him often enough that he
ought to cut it out, but he says he doesn’t care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
whether he gets on the eleven next fall or not.
That’s just guff, of course. If they had spring
football practice here he’d behave himself, but
they don’t. Only trouble with Kewpie is he’s
lost his ambition.”</p>

<p>After that long speech Ned subsided further
into the rocker. Mae looked across at him admiringly.
“I’m sure Ned’s quite right, Polly,”
she declared.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad if he is,” said Polly with a sigh
of relief. “I was dreadfully afraid that he had
some—some secret sorrow in his life, like—like a
cruel stepmother or—or a father who drank or
something. If it’s only what Ned thinks it is,
why, everything’s quite easy, because getting on
the baseball team will be just the thing for him.”</p>

<p>“How’s he going to get there?” asked Laurie
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you said he wanted you to
help him!”</p>

<p>“I did, but what he wants and what I aim to
do—”</p>

<p>“Kewpie couldn’t play baseball, Polly,” said
Ned. “Look at him!”</p>

<p>“But I’ve seen stout boys play baseball plenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of times,” Polly protested. “Two years ago we
had a first baseman on the high school team who
was every bit as fat as Kewpie Proudtree. You
remember George Wallen, Mae.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t only his fatness, or stoutness, or
whatever you like to call it,” insisted Laurie.
“He isn’t built right for baseball. Gee, think
of Kewpie trying to beat out a bunt or sliding to
second! Besides, hang it, I couldn’t get him on
the team if he really could pitch! Pinky said
positively—”</p>

<p>“Is he a pitcher?” asked Polly eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, but he wants people to think he is.”</p>

<p>“But that would make it lots easier, Laurie!
A pitcher doesn’t have to run much, and—”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he? Don’t you think he has to
take his turn at the bat sometimes?”</p>

<p>“But he never hits the ball,” replied Polly triumphantly,
“and so he doesn’t need to run!”</p>

<p>“She had you there, partner,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, just the same,” answered Laurie, grinning,
“I’ll be hanged if I’m going to ask Pinky to
let Kewpie on the squad just so he won’t be lonesome.
Pinky wouldn’t listen to me, anyway.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know,” said Polly. “And I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
you really ought to try. Yes, I do! Kewpie’s
having a miserable time of it, and he’s ruining
himself for football, and it’s our duty to the
school to do everything we can so he won’t!”</p>

<p>“Say that again,” begged Ned, but Polly paid
no heed.</p>

<p>“Besides,” she went on warmly, “we all pretend
to be his friends, and I guess a friend ought
to be willing to make some sacrifices for you, and
it wouldn’t be very much for Laurie to get him
on the baseball team and—”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I can’t do it!” wailed Laurie.</p>

<p>“You don’t know. You haven’t tried. Don’t
you think he ought to try, Mae?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” said that young lady decisively.</p>

<p>“Don’t you, Ned?” persisted Polly earnestly.</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it in the world,” answered
Ned gravely.</p>

<p>Laurie glared indignantly at him, but Ned was
looking at Towser. After a brief silence Laurie
sighed gloomily.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “But I can tell you right
now that it won’t do any good. Mr. Mulford said
he wouldn’t take on any fellow who didn’t report<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
for early practice, and he means it. Besides,
Kewpie’s no more of a pitcher than—than I am!”</p>

<p>“I know, Laurie,” said Polly persuasively,
“but maybe with practice, and if you showed
him—”</p>

<p>Ned chortled. Laurie, although he wanted to
smile, kept a straight face.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he agreed, “I might do that.
Well, I’ll do it, though I’ll feel like a perfect ass
when I speak to Pinky about it.”</p>

<p>“There,” said Polly in triumph. “I knew we
could do something if we all put our heads together!
And I do hope it will be all right.
Kewpie’s really a very dear boy, and he certainly
did wonderfully at football last fall and he’s
just got to keep on. I do think, though, that we
should keep this quite to ourselves, don’t you,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“Don’t just see how we can. If Kewpie gets
on the baseball squad he’s almost sure to know
something about it. He’s not such a fool as he
looks sometimes, Polly.”</p>

<p>Polly stared. “I don’t see—” she began.
Then the twinkle in Ned’s eye explained. “Of
course I didn’t mean that, silly! I meant that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Kewpie shouldn’t know that we—that we’d been
discussing him and that we had—well, conspired,
Ned. Don’t you see? He might resent it or
something.”</p>

<p>“I get you! We’ll make a secret society out
of it, eh? Association for the Restoration—no,
that won’t do.”</p>

<p>“Advancement,” suggested Mae.</p>

<p>“Association for the Reclamation of Kewpie
Proudtree!” pronounced Ned. “And the password—”</p>

<p>“Association for the Degradation of Laurence
Turner, you mean,” said Laurie dejectedly.
“And there isn’t any password, because he won’t
pass!”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ned. “But the dues are
twenty cents. Here you are, Polly. You’ve got
‘treasurer’ written all over you.”</p>

<p>“But—but what is it?” asked Polly, refusing
to accept the two dimes that Ned proffered.</p>

<p>“Madam, I am settling the debt of none other
than our distinguished and rattle-brained friend
Kewpie. At his request. It seems he—er—he
neglected to settle for the entertainment you provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
him this afternoon, and, torn by remorse—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew he forgot!” exclaimed Polly
gladly.</p>

<p>“He would,” said Laurie pessimistically. “He
has a perfectly remarkable forgetory. I guess
he’s the champion long-distance forgetter—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be horrid,” begged Polly. “With so
much on his mind, it’s no wonder he—”</p>

<p>“On his <em>what</em>?” exclaimed Laurie. “Ned, did
you get that? Kewpie has so much on his mind!
Honest, Polly, when Kewpie takes his cap off he
hasn’t—”</p>

<p>The kettle caused a diversion by boiling over
just then, and the conference broke up.</p>

<p>Kewpie awaited Laurie in No. 16, and as the
twins entered he broke into speech. “Say, Nod,
when—”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning. Half-past ten. Back
of the gym,” replied Laurie promptly. Kewpie
stared, puzzled.</p>

<p>“What?” he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>Laurie performed an exaggerated parody of a
pitcher winding up and delivering a ball. Then,
assuming the rôle of catcher, he leaped high off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
his feet and pulled down a wild one that would
undoubtedly have smashed the upper pane of the
further window had it got by him.</p>

<p>“Honest?” cried Kewpie. “Me and you?”</p>

<p>“No, you and me.”</p>

<p>“But—how did you know what I was going to
ask?”</p>

<p>Laurie viewed him sadly. “Kewpie,” he replied,
“it’s a mighty good thing you decided to be
a pitcher. That’s the only position that doesn’t
call for any brain!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Laurie folded Kewpie’s sweater and placed
it on the ground a few yards from the
gymnasium wall. “There’s your plate,” he announced.
“See if you can put ’em over the
middle button, Kewpie.”</p>

<p>Kewpie tightened his belt, thumped a worn
baseball into a blackened glove, and rather ostentatiously
dug a hole in the moist turf with his
heel. Laurie grinned. Here on the south side
of the building the sun shone warmly and the
ground was fairly dry. Behind Laurie about
four yards away, was a wire fence which, if
Kewpie retained ordinary control of the ball,
would make life easier for Ned, who sat in the
embrasure of a basement window. Laurie pulled
his mitten on and waited. Kewpie was at last
satisfied with the hole he had dug and fitted his
toe into it. Then he looked speculatively at the
folded sweater and wrapped his fingers about the
ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“What’s this going to be, Kewpie?” asked
Ned. “A drop?”</p>

<p>“Straight ball. Just warming up.” Kewpie
let go, and the ball struck the fence and bounded
back. Laurie sighed and went after it.</p>

<p>“I’m not as young as I was, Kewpie,” he said,
“and anything more than ten feet on either side
of me is likely to get away. See if you can put
’em somewhere near the plate.”</p>

<p>Kewpie laughed. “That one got away from
me, Nod.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Laurie. “Let her come.
Shoot her in!”</p>

<p>Kewpie’s next offering was a good deal better,
and Laurie didn’t have to move to get it.
Kewpie sent four or five more balls within reasonable
distance of the sweater. There was no
speed in them, nor were they other than perfectly
straight offerings. Still, as Laurie reflected encouragingly,
it was something to be able to do that
much. He was not quite sure he could do it himself
the first few times.</p>

<p>“All right, old son,” he called. “Speed ’em
up now.”</p>

<p>But speed did not seem to be included in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Kewpie’s budget of tricks. The first attempt
sent the ball over Laurie’s head and likewise over
the fence. While Ned, sighing, went after it,
Laurie indulged in gentle sarcasms. Kewpie
thumped his glove with a bare fist and
smiled genially. Then the ball came back, and
Kewpie began again. Laurie picked the ball from
the trampled turf between his feet and viewed
Kewpie questioningly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have some drop on that?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Kewpie. “Here’s another.
You watch it.”</p>

<p>Laurie did watch it. And it did drop. A
faint, new-born respect for Kewpie as a pitcher
was reflected in his voice as he said: “That’s
not so poor, old thing. Where’d you learn
it?”</p>

<p>But Kewpie was throwing his chest out now,
a purely unnecessary thing for Kewpie to do, and
strutting a bit. “Never you mind,” he answered.
“I told you I had something, and you wouldn’t
believe me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” remarked Ned, “but
you’ve got to know more than just how to pitch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
a drop if you’re going to put Nate Beedle out of
business.”</p>

<p>“That’s not half so worse,” commented Laurie
after the next ball had performed a very creditable
drop, “but let’s see something else, old son.
How about a curve just for variety?”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” said Kewpie, “I haven’t got curves
down so well, but—” He spent a long moment
fingering the ball and finally sent it off with a
decidedly round-arm delivery. Laurie caught it
by leaping far to the left.</p>

<p>“What was that supposed to be?” he asked
politely.</p>

<p>“In-shoot,” said Kewpie, but his tone lacked
conviction.</p>

<p>“Huh,” returned Laurie, “you ain’t so well in
your in-shoot. Better see a doctor about it. Try
an out, old son.”</p>

<p>But Kewpie’s out wasn’t any better, and, at
the end of about twenty minutes, by which time
Ned was the only member of the trio not bathed
in perspiration, it had been shown conclusively
that Kewpie’s one and only claim to pitching
fame rested on a not very remarkable drop-ball.
Laurie picked up Kewpie’s sweater and returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
it to him gravely. “Better put that on,” he said
with vast concern. “It would be awful if you
got cold in that arm of yours.”</p>

<p>Kewpie struggled with the garment, breathing
heavily, and when he had conquered it he turned
expectantly to Laurie. “Well, what do you
say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to say?” Laurie
stared frowningly at his mitten.</p>

<p>“Why, you know what I asked you,” said
Kewpie. “I—you—”</p>

<p>“But, great jumpin’ Jupiter, Kewpie, I can’t
ask Pinky to put you on the squad just because
you can pitch a sort of a drop! You haven’t an
ounce of speed; you can’t curve ’em—”</p>

<p>“Well, but I haven’t had any work!” protested
the other. “Gee, I guess Nate Beedle
couldn’t do much better the first time he
pitched!”</p>

<p>“But Nate knows <em>how</em>, you simple fish! All
the work in the world won’t make you any better
if—”</p>

<p>“Practice makes perfect, don’t it?” interrupted
Kewpie indignantly.</p>

<p>“Maybe. Maybe not. If you don’t know anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
about pitching you can practise from now
until—”</p>

<p>“But I do know, I tell you. All I need is
practice. I’ve got a book that tells—”</p>

<p>“Book be blowed!” exploded Laurie. “You
can’t learn pitching by taking a correspondence-course,
you fat-head!”</p>

<p>“Quit your arguing, you two,” said Ned.
“Laurie’s quite right, Kewpie. He can’t recommend
you to Mr. Mulford until you’ve got more
to show than you’ve shown just now. But I don’t
see what’s to prevent you from learning more
tricks or what’s to prevent Laurie from helping
you if he can. Seems to me the thing to do is
for you two to get together every day for a
while.” Ned was looking meaningly at his
brother. “Maybe Kewpie’s got it in him,
Laurie. You can’t tell yet, eh?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, no, I suppose not. No, you can’t
tell. Maybe with practice—”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” agreed Ned. “That’s it; practice,
Kewpie. Now you and Laurie fix it up between
you to get together for half an hour every
morning, savvy? Maybe after a week or
so—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Kewpie, beaming. “Gee,
in a week I’ll be speeding them over like—like
anything!”</p>

<p>Laurie looked at him pityingly. “You—you
poor prune!” he sighed. Ned surreptitiously
kicked him on a shin and quickly drowned
Kewpie’s hurt protest with, “There! That’s
fine! Come on, Laurie, it’s nearly eleven.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Laurie, rubbing the shin.
“See you later, Kewpie, and we’ll fix up a time
for practice.” Out of ear-shot of the more leisurely
Kewpie, Laurie turned bitterly on his
brother. “It’s all right for you,” he complained,
“but that poor fish doesn’t know any more about
pitching than I know about—about my Latin this
morning! It’s all right for you, but—”</p>

<p>“You said that before,” interrupted Ned unfeelingly.
“Look here, old-timer, did we or
didn’t we agree to help Kewpie? Are you or
aren’t you a member of the Association for the
Reclamation—”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m a member! And I’m the goat,
too, it seems like! I have to do all the dirty work
while you stand around and bark up my shins!
How do you get that way? You can catch a ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
if you try. Suppose you take Kewpie on some
of the time and see how you like it!”</p>

<p>“I would in an instant,” responded Ned, “if
you’d let me, but you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t!” echoed Laurie incredulously as
he followed the other up-stairs to No. 16. “Say,
you ain’t so well! You just try me!”</p>

<p>But Ned shook his head, smiling gently.
“Just now, old son, you’re not quite yourself.
When your better nature asserts itself you’ll—”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” growled Laurie. “Throw me
my Latin. There goes the bell!”</p>

<p>Kewpie took his ball back to No. 15, pulled a
small paper-bound book entitled “How to Pitch”
from a table drawer, and curled himself on the
window-seat. Presently, as he turned the pages
slowly, his usually placid countenance became
troubled. Reaching for the ball, he wound his
fingers about it, his eyes ever and anon traveling
to the book. Finally he arose, gathered the pillows
from the two beds, and set them upright
against the closet door, side by side. Then he
moved an arm-chair out of the way and, having
fitted his fingers around the scuffed baseball as
indicated in Diagram 6, let fly. Naturally, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
distance was much too short to show whether or
not he had held the ball correctly, but Kewpie was
an optimist by nature. Several times he followed
the instructions accompanying Diagram 6, not always
landing the ball against the pillows, however,
and then gave his attention to Diagram 7.
He was very busy striving to diagnose its requirements
when “Hop” entered.</p>

<p>Hop’s real name was Thurman Kendrick, and
he had the honor of being Kewpie’s room-mate.
They were both football players and of an age,
but there the likeness ceased. Hop was rather
small and slim, with dark hair and an earnest
countenance, a description that didn’t fit Kewpie
at all. Hop was Hillman’s most likely candidate
for next year’s quarter-back. Fortunately, the
two boys worked together quite as smoothly on
the gridiron as center and quarter as they did on
the campus as room-mates. Or you may put it
the other way around if you like, the idea being
that they were the very best of chums off the
field and on. But even a chum may have to assert
authority once in a while, and Hop asserted
it now.</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re doing, Kewpie?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
he demanded in puzzlement. “Practising?
Well, you pick those pillows up and put that ball
down or I’ll paddle you! Look here, did you get
a cut in English?”</p>

<p>Kewpie looked blank. “Gee, no! What time
of day is it? Well, what do you know about that?
I just naturally—”</p>

<p>“You’ll just naturally get the dickens from
Johnny, you silly chump,” responded Hop dryly
as he dumped his books on the table. “What did
you do? forget the time?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I—I guess I got sort of interested in
this pitching business, Hop. Say, you ought to
have seen me pitching drops to Nod a while
back! Boy, I’ll say I made ’em eat out of my
hand!”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be eating off the mantel if I catch
you missing any more recitations! Honest,
Kewpie, you haven’t got the sense of a duck.
Besides, what the dickens do you want to get
into baseball for? Isn’t football good enough?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but I can’t play football now, can I?
How do you suppose I’m going to keep myself in
condition for it if I don’t have some exercise?”</p>

<p>“I don’t have much trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Of course you don’t, but you’re not cursed
with fat, Hop. It’s a terrible thing to be cursed
with fat,” he said sadly.</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible thing to be cursed with a fat
head,” replied Hop severely. “You’ve got about
as much chance of getting on the baseball team
as I have of—of—” But Hop couldn’t think of
a satisfactory simile and so changed the subject.
“Say, what’s Nod Turner been doing to Elk
Thurston?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I heard something about Elk’s
bicycle, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, Elk’s as sore as a pup about something,
and— For goodness’ sake, put that ball away before
you break something! How the dickens did
I ever get hitched up with an idiot like you, anyway,
I’d like to know!”</p>

<p>“Providence was watching over you, old chap,”
answered Kewpie cheerfully. “As unworthy as
you are—”</p>

<p>“Dry up,” laughed Hop, “and see if you can
keep still long enough for me to find out why
Johnny gave me only eighty-four on this theme.”</p>

<p>“Johnny has an awful crust,” said Kewpie
sympathetically. “Wonder what he marked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
mine. Didn’t think to ask for it, did you?”</p>

<p>“I did not. <em>Shut up!</em>”</p>

<p>Laurie dropped around to the Widow Deane’s
about five thirty that afternoon. It was getting
to be something of a habit with him. Over a
glass of root-beer he narrated to Polly the events
of the morning. “He’s a perfect duffer at
pitching,” he summed up finally, “and I guess I
won’t ever have to trouble Pinky about him.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps he will learn,” said Polly hopefully.
“And, anyway, he’s—he’s a changed
mortal already, Laurie!”</p>

<p>“He’s a what?”</p>

<p>“I mean he’s different already. He was in
this afternoon, and he had just a plain soda and
only one cream-puff, and he was just as jolly as
anything. Why, you wouldn’t know him for the
same boy!”</p>

<p>Somehow these glad tidings didn’t appear to
endow Laurie with any great feeling of uplift.
He said, “Huh,” and took another sip of his root-beer.
Polly went on earnestly.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s just having something to interest
him, something to live for, that’s changed
him. Why, even if nothing actually came of it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Laurie, we’ve already done him a lot of good.”</p>

<p>“Great,” said Laurie. “I guess he’s got all
the good that’s coming to him, then. He will
never make a baseball pitcher.”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t tell him that, even if you
believe it,” said Polly earnestly. “You must encourage
him, you know. We all must.”</p>

<p>Laurie grinned. “I’ve already told him he’s
no good. I guess I told him so several times.
But he doesn’t believe it, so there’s no harm
done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Polly.
“Don’t you see, if he’s to be—be taken out of
himself, Laurie, he must—must have faith?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s got it, all right. I’m the one who
hasn’t. He thinks he’s the coming scholastic
wonder of the diamond, I guess. Of course,
I’m perfectly willing to help the chap and keep
him from killing himself off with cream-puffs, and
that sort of thing, Polly, but you’ve got to own
up that it’s a bit tough on me. Think of putting
in half an hour every day with Kewpie! Gee,
I’ve got troubles of my own, too. That silly
Elk Thurston’s got it in for me, after that trifling
affair of yesterday, and there’s no working in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
same cage with him. It wouldn’t be so bad if
we weren’t both trying for the same job.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Elkins Thurston is a
catcher, too?”</p>

<p>“He is if I am,” answered Laurie smiling.
“More, I guess, for he did some catching last
spring with the second. Still, at that, he isn’t
so much better. We’re both pretty bad yet,
Polly.”</p>

<p>“What does he do that—that you don’t like,
Laurie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just acts ugly and nags whenever he gets
a chance. If he keeps it up I’ll crown him with
a bat some fine day!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t get into any fuss with him,”
said Polly decidedly. “He’s a lot bigger than
you and—”</p>

<p>“Huh, that’s why I mean to use a bat!”</p>

<p>“Besides, you shouldn’t have taken his bicycle.
You see, Laurie, you really started the trouble
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I did, but he shouldn’t be so
touchy. Anyway, I don’t intend—”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the opening of the door
and the tinkling of the bell. <a href="#i_fp056">A frail-looking little</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
<a href="#i_fp056">woman in a queer old-fashioned dress</a> and a
funny little flat bonnet entered and Polly went
to attend to her. The two talked together across
the opposite counter in low tones, and, just to
show that he was not trying to overhear them,
Laurie whistled softly. After a minute or two
the little woman went out and Polly rejoined
Laurie.</p>

    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_57">A pleasant-faced little lady in a queer, old-fashioned dress</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I feel so sorry for her,” said Polly with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Laurie. “Who
is she?”</p>

<p>“That’s Miss Comfort.” Polly seemed surprised
that Laurie didn’t know it. “She lives
on the next corner, in the little white house that
faces the park. She makes most of our cakes
and pies. Don’t you remember—”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Laurie, “but that’s the
first time I ever saw her, I guess. But why are
you sorry for her?”</p>

<p>“Because she’s got to get out of that house,
and she hasn’t any place to go. And she must
be almost seventy years old, Laurie. Just think
of it!”</p>

<p>“Well, but aren’t there any other houses in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Orstead? Seems to me I saw one just the other
day over on Washington Street that had a ‘To
Rent’ sign in front.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s the old Cummings house, and
it has sixteen rooms and rents for goodness knows
what! You see, Miss Comfort had the use of
the house she was in as long as her sister lived.
Her sister was married and lived out West somewhere;
Ohio or Iowa, I think. Well, she died last
December, and now some lawyer has written her
that she must vacate on the first of next month.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t give her much time, and that’s a
fact,” commented Laurie sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s known for quite a while, but the
trouble is she hasn’t a cent of money.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Laurie. “How come?”</p>

<p>“I guess she never did have any. That house
belonged to her mother, and she died a long time
ago and left a funny will that let Miss Comfort
stay there until her sister died. She’s been getting
along pretty well by making cakes and things
and selling them. She makes the best cake in
town, and every one buys of her. But I guess
she’s never made more than enough money to
just live on. I know that winter before last,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
when coal was so high, she shut up all the rooms
except the kitchen and lived there with just the
stove for warmth. And goodness knows when
she’s had a new dress. I declare she’s worn
that one she had on just now ever since I’ve been
in Orstead, Laurie!”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s tough luck for the old girl,” said
Laurie. “Must be some place for her, though.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one place I know of,” said Polly
sadly, “and that’s the poor-farm. Of course,
she’ll be well taken care of, and they’ll let her
go on making cake and selling it, but she hates it
dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“I should think she might! At her age!
Gee!”</p>

<p>“Mama and I thought of having her here, but
there’s only the two rooms up-stairs, and while
it would be all right for a while it wouldn’t do
as a—a permanent arrangement.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t there any one else who could give
her a home? Some one who has more room?
What about the folks in her church?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course there’s been talk of helping
her, and I’m certain quite a lot of folks will give
money, but I don’t believe she’d take it, Laurie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
And even if she got quite a lot, even a hundred
dollars, it wouldn’t pay house-rent very long,
would it?”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars!” snorted Laurie. “Say,
they must be a lot of pikers. Why—”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Laurie, they’re not. You see,
they’re not very well off themselves, and the
congregation isn’t a large one at all. A hundred
dollars would be quite a lot of money to them.”</p>

<p>“So the poor old lady’s got to go to the poor-farm,
eh?” mused Laurie, frowning.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” sighed Polly. “She’s never
talked to me about it, but mama said this morning
that she guessed Miss Comfort had about reconciled
herself. And just now she came in to
apologize for not sending two cakes she had promised
for this afternoon. I guess the poor dear’s
too worried and upset to make them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so,” Laurie agreed. “I call that
tough luck. ‘Miss Comfort.’ Gee, I’ll bet she
hasn’t really known what comfort is, Polly!”</p>

<p>“Not since her mother died, probably. But
she’s always been just as cheerful and happy as
any one could be until just lately. She’s a perfect
dear, Laurie, and I could cry when I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of her having to go to that po-poor-farm!”</p>

<p>Dismayed by the catch in Polly’s voice, and
horribly afraid that she was really going to cry,
Laurie suddenly recalled the fact that he must
get back to school. “Well, I—I suppose there
isn’t anything any one can do,” he murmured
awkwardly. “Maybe the poor-farm won’t be so
bad. I suppose it’s the idea of it that sort of
gets her, eh? Well, I must be trundling along,
Polly.”</p>

<p>Laurie gave a farewell suck at his straw, which
resulted in only a gurgling sound at the bottom
of his glass, and dropped off the counter.</p>

<p>“Well, see you to-morrow,” he announced
cheerfully. “Good night, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Polly. “But you didn’t
need to run away. I hadn’t any intention of
cr-crying!”</p>

<small>LAURIE TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Laurie’s rush to get back to school did not
prevent him from pausing when, having
turned the corner into Summit Street and proceeded
half-way along the block, he caught sight
of Bob Starling in the back garden of the Coventry
place. The Coventry place, which consisted
of a big square house set at the Walnut Street end
of a broad and deep plot of land facing the school
property, had been rented by Bob’s father, who
was the engineer in charge of the big new railroad
bridge in course of construction near Orstead.
Bob was entered at Hillman’s School as a
day-student. He was sixteen years old, a slim
but well built chap with a very attractive countenance.
Bob’s mission in life, as he believed,
was to play a great deal of tennis and play it better
than any one else. In that mission he very
nearly succeeded. It was tennis that was accountable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
for his presence just now in the back
yard, as Laurie well knew.</p>

<p>“How soon are you going to start work?”
called Laurie.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nod! Come on in!”</p>

<p>“Can’t. Nearly six. What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Just looking around,” replied Bob, drawing
near. “I’ve got the stakes all set. Gosh, if the
ground would dry up so they could begin to dig
I’d have the old court ready in a week.”</p>

<p>“I guess so.” Laurie nodded. “Well, a few
more days like this will do the trick. Say, remember
how we planned to make a pergola out of
that old lumber that came out of the arbor you
pulled down?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll do it as soon as the court’s
made. Dad’s got me twenty loads of the finest
cinders you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Good work! Reckon you’ll be giving tennis
teas in another month, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Before that if the weather behaves. Been
over to the Widow’s?” Bob grinned faintly.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Laurie’s reply sounded a trifle defiant.</p>

<p>“How’s Polly? Haven’t seen her for days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s holding up bravely under your neglect,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
answered Laurie. Then, having avoided
Bob’s playful punch, he added, “she’s sort of
broke up, though, over Miss Comfort.”</p>

<p>“Who? Oh, the old dame that makes cake.
Yes, my aunt was saying something about her at
dinner yesterday. They’re putting her out of
her house or something, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>Laurie nodded. “It’s a blamed shame, too,”
he said indignantly. “Why, say, Bob, she’s over
seventy! And one of the nicest old ladies in
town, too. Always cheerful and happy and—and
sunny, you know. One of the—er—well, a fine
character, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, I didn’t know you were so well acquainted
with her, Nod!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know her so very well personally,”
replied Laurie, “but Polly says—”</p>

<p>“Oh!” chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>Laurie scowled. “I don’t see anything very
funny in it,” he protested. “A perfectly corking
old lady like Miss Comfort having to go to the
poor-farm! At her age! Almost eighty!”</p>

<p>“Hold on! She was seventy a minute ago!
Who says she’s going to the poor-farm?”</p>

<p>“Pol—everybody! I call it a rotten shame!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, so do I,” agreed Bob, “but I don’t
see why you are so het up about it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh? Well, if she was <em>your</em>
mother—”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t be, Nod; she isn’t married.
And I don’t believe she’s yours, either, no matter
what you say.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say she was,” replied Laurie a trifle
irritably. “I only said—I was just trying to
make you see— Gee, you haven’t any heart at
all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be an ass,” laughed Bob. “I
haven’t said anything against the poor old soul.
I’m mighty sorry for her, just as sorry as you
are, but I can’t do anything about it, can I?”</p>

<p>“No, but you needn’t laugh at her!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t laughing at her, you nut! I—”</p>

<p>“Besides,” continued Laurie, “if every one
took your attitude about—about things, saying,
‘I can’t help it, can I?’ I’d like to know what sort
of a world this would be.”</p>

<p>“Well, hang it, I can’t!” said Bob emphatically,
getting a trifle riled at his friend’s unreasonableness.
“Neither can you. So why stand
there and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“How do you know I can’t?” demanded Laurie
with much hauteur. “I haven’t said I couldn’t.
In fact, I—I’m going to!”</p>

<p>“You are?” exclaimed Bob incredulously.
“How, Nod?”</p>

<p>The note of respect in Bob’s voice dispelled
Laurie’s annoyance perceptibly. “I don’t know—yet,”
he answered. But there was something
in his voice, or maybe in the emphasis put on the
final word, or possibly in his manner, that caused
Bob to think that he did know. “Oh, come on and
tell me, Nod,” he asked. “Let me in on it.
Maybe I can help, eh? Gosh, I’ll say it’s fierce
to use a fine old lady like that! Are you going
to get up a subscription or a—I know! A benefit,
eh?”</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head, glancing at his watch
as he did so. “I can’t tell you anything about it—yet,”
he replied. “But maybe—as soon as I
get the details settled—I’ve got to do a lot of
thinking, you know, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Well, listen, let me in on it, will you?
I’d love to do something, you know. I always
thought Miss Comfort was a mighty fine old girl—I
mean lady, Nod!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“She is,” said Laurie almost reverentially.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Bob solemnly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see you to-morrow. Keep it to
yourself, though. I don’t want my plans all
spoiled by—by a lot of silly talk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say you don’t! Good night, Nod.”</p>

<p>When he had reached the corner it began to
dawn on Laurie that, as Elk had told him yesterday,
he talked too much! “Got myself into a
nice mess,” he thought ruefully. “Suppose I’ve
got to go ahead and bluff it out with Bob now.
Wonder what got into me. No—no discretion,
that’s my trouble. I ain’t so well in my circumspection,
I guess. Better see a doctor about
it! Oh, well—”</p>

<p>The next morning Laurie and Kewpie took advantage
of an empty period soon after breakfast
and again sought the south side of the gymnasium
building. To-day Kewpie sought to
demonstrate an out-shoot. He was not very successful,
although Laurie had to acknowledge that
now and then the ball did deviate slightly from
the straight line. Sometimes it deviated to such
purpose that he couldn’t reach it at all, but
Kewpie made no claims at such times. He said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the ball slipped. In the end, Kewpie went back
to his famous drop and managed to elicit faint
applause from Laurie.</p>

<p>Laurie couldn’t get his heart into the business
this morning. Despite his efforts to forget it,
that idiotic boast to Bob Starling kept returning
to his mind to bother him. Either he must confess
to Bob that he hadn’t meant a word of what
he had said or he must think up some scheme of,
at least, pretending to seek aid for Miss Comfort.
He liked Bob a whole lot and he valued Bob’s
opinion of him, and he hated to confess that he
had just let his tongue run away with him. On
the other hand, there wasn’t a thing he could do
that would be of any practical help to Miss Comfort.
He would just have to bluff, he concluded:
make believe that he was doing a lot of heavy
thinking and finally just let the thing peter out.
Quite unjustly Laurie experienced a feeling of
mild distaste for Miss Comfort.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forenoon, Bob, meeting
him in the corridor, would have stopped him, but
Laurie pushed by with a great display of haste,
briefly replying in the negative to Bob’s mysteriously
whispered inquiry: “Anything new,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Nod?” After that, not having yet decided on any
sort of a scheme to present to the other, Laurie
avoided Bob as though the latter had measles.</p>

<p>At practice in the baseball cage he gave so much
thought to the matter of saving his face with Bob
that he made very poor work of catching and batting.
He was, in fact, so detached from what was
going on that even Elk Thurston’s gibes fell on
deaf ears. Mr. Mulford, the coach, got after
him many times that afternoon.</p>

<p>When practice was over Laurie fairly dawdled
about the showers and dressing-room, and it was
nearly half-past five when he finally set out for
the Widow Deane’s, making his way there by a
roundabout route that took him nowhere in sight
of the Coventry place. He expected to find Ned
there before him, but the little shop was deserted
save for a small child buying penny candy and
Mrs. Deane, who was waiting on the customer.
Polly, said Mrs. Deane, had gone to Mae Ferrand’s.
Laurie disconsolately ordered a root-beer
and, overcoming an inclination to sit on the
counter, listened to Mrs. Deane’s unexciting budget
of news. He was not very attentive, although
Mrs. Deane never suspected the fact, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
might have shown some surprise when he broke
into her account of Polly’s concern over Antoinette,
the rabbit who lived in a box in the back
yard, because Antoinette hadn’t been eating well
for several days, by asking suddenly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Deane, is it straight about Miss Comfort
having to go to the poor-farm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I’m afraid so.” Mrs. Deane
sighed. “Isn’t it a pity? I—we did want to
take her in here with us, Laurie, but I suppose
we simply couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, look; what about this brother of hers?”</p>

<p>“Brother? Why, she hasn’t any—”</p>

<p>“Eh! Oh, brother-in-law, I meant; the fellow
who married her sister out in Ohio.”</p>

<p>“Iowa,” Mrs. Deane corrected. “Why, I just
don’t know. When she got word from the lawyers
that she must vacate the house she wrote
to him, but she says he never took any notice of
her letter.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she write again? Maybe he didn’t
get it.”</p>

<p>“Why, no, she didn’t. She’s sort of—well, I
suppose you might say proud, but I’d almost call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it touchy. She just wouldn’t write another letter,
although I advised her to.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s he want the house for?” asked
Laurie, frowning. “Is he coming here to live in
it, or what?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Deane shook her head. “I don’t know,
but I did hear that Mr. Sparks had told some one
that they were going to tear it down and put up a
two-family house there.”</p>

<p>“He’s the banker, isn’t he? Well, I think it’s
mighty funny that this brother-in-law chap
doesn’t write to her. She ought to get after him
again. Or some one ought to do it for her, if she
won’t. It doesn’t seem to me, Mrs. Deane, that
any man would want to turn his own sister-in-law
into the poor-house. Maybe he doesn’t really
know how she’s fixed.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe so, Laurie. I’m sure I’d like
to think so. But letters don’t often go astray,
and I’m afraid this Mr. Goupil—”</p>

<p>“Is that his name? I’ll say he’s a goop!
How does he spell it?”</p>

<p>“G-o-u-p-i-l, Goupil. A. G. Goupil, I think she
said. He’s quite wealthy, or, anyway, I gathered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
so from what she let fall. Makes some sort of
machinery. The Goupil Machinery Company is
the name. I don’t suppose it would hurt him the
least tiny bit to let poor Miss Comfort stay right
where she is, but sometimes it does seem that the
more money folks have the less feeling they’ve
got. I don’t know as I’d ought to say that,
either, for—”</p>

<p>“Do you know what place in Iowa he lives?”</p>

<p>“Why, I did know, Laurie, but I don’t recall
it now. It was a sort of funny name, though I’ve
heard it lots of times.”</p>

<p>“Was it—was it—” Laurie realized blankly
that he couldn’t remember the name of a single
town or city in Iowa. Mrs. Deane watched him
expectantly. Laurie concentrated hard and, at
last, “Was it Omaha?” he asked. Then, as Mrs.
Deane shook her head, “anyway,” he added,
“that’s in Nebraska, come to think of it.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” mused Mrs. Deane, “that it
was a—a sort of Indian name, like—like—”</p>

<p>“Sioux City!” shouted Laurie.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Mrs. Deane, quite pleased.
“I don’t see how you ever thought of it. Sioux
City, Iowa; yes, that was it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Laurie was writing on the back of a piece of
paper with his fountain-pen. “Look here, Mrs.
Deane,” he said eagerly, “why don’t we write to
this Goop ourselves, if she won’t? Or why don’t
we telegraph him? That would be better, because
folks always pay more attention to telegrams
than they do to letters. Only”—Laurie’s face
clouded a trifle—“I wonder how much it costs to
Sioux City.”</p>

<p>“Why—why—,” began Mrs. Deane a little
breathlessly, “do you think it would be quite
right? You see, Laurie, maybe I’d ought to consider
what she told me as confidential. I’m not
sure she would like it a bit, she’s so sort of
touch—proud.”</p>

<p>“Well, you stay out of it, then,” said Laurie
resolutely. “I’ll attend to it myself, and if
there’s any blame, why, I’ll take it. But I certainly
do think that some one ought to—ought to
do something, Mrs. Deane. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose they ought, Laurie, maybe.
But perhaps it’s taking a good deal on yourself—I
mean—”</p>

<p>“She needn’t know anything about it unless
Goop comes across with an answer, and what she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
doesn’t know isn’t going to hurt her. You leave
it to me, and don’t say anything about it to Miss
Comfort. I’ll send this Goop guy a telegram
that’ll wake him up. He ain’t so well in his
goop. He ought to see—”</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>That was Polly, to the accompaniment of the
tinkling bell in the next room.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell Polly!” hissed Laurie, and Polly’s
mother somewhat blankly nodded agreement.</p>

<p>“We’ve been talking about Miss Comfort,” announced
Laurie as Polly joined them.</p>

<p>“Oh, is there anything new, mama? Has she
heard from the lawyers again?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” answered Mrs. Deane.
“I haven’t seen her yet. She said she’d bring
over those cream-puffs and the layer-cake, but
she hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Shall I run over and ask about them?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t think you’d better, dear. I
dare say she’s just too upset to get things baked.
I know myself how contrary ovens will act when
you can’t give your whole mind to them. Maybe
she’ll be over in a little while.”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort remained the subject of conversation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
for another ten minutes, and then Laurie,
suddenly realizing that it was alarmingly close
to dinner-time, winked meaningly at Mrs. Deane,
said good night, and bolted. This time he made
no attempt to avoid Bob Starling. Bob, however,
was not in sight as Laurie sped by the big house.</p>

<p>“I’ll telephone him to come over after dinner,”
reflected Laurie. “I sort of promised to
let him in on it. Besides, I’ll bet it costs a lot
to telegraph to Iowa!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>LAURIE TALKS TOO MUCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">But Laurie didn’t have to telephone to Bob.
Bob was waiting in No. 16 when the twins
returned from supper. There had been no opportunity
to take Ned into his confidence in dining-hall,
and, since Laurie wouldn’t have thought of
embarking on even the most inconsequential enterprise
without his brother’s aid, the first step,
as he now saw it, was to put Ned in possession of
the facts. So, closing and locking the door in
the manner of a conspirator, Laurie faced the
eager Bob and the mystified Ned and began the
recital of the pathetic story of Miss Comfort.
And, as Laurie told it, it certainly was pathetic.
Having found, as he believed, a way of making
good his boast to Bob the day before, he set out
determinedly to win his hearers to the cause. He
not only wanted moral aid and counsel but pecuniary
assistance in the matter of that telegram to
Sioux City! So he made a very moving story of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
it, picturing Miss Comfort as a penniless and
hard-working little woman battling heroically
against the tides of adversity with unfaltering
courage, Mr. Goupil as a monster of cruelty, and
Mr. Goupil’s lawyer as a fiend in human form.
Miss Comfort’s age was now given as “over
eighty,” an estimate that caused Bob to gasp.
Laurie even attempted to dwell on the horrors of
existence for a well bred lady like Miss Comfort
on the poor-farm. But, never having had close
acquaintance with such an institution, he had to
confine himself to generalities and dark insinuations,
and, discovering that his audience was not
as much impressed as he meant them to be, he
wisely switched back to Miss Comfort herself and
told how in the winter, too poverty-stricken to
buy coal for the furnace, she lived in the kitchen,
while her brother-in-law, rolling in riches, gave
her no thought.</p>

<p>Ned, who, at the beginning of the narrative, had
worn a smile of careless, tolerant amusement,
was soon frowning troubledly. Then indignation
swelled within him, and he glowered darkly upon
Laurie as though the latter was all to blame for
Miss Comfort’s plight. Bob appeared moved almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
to tears. As an orator Laurie did himself
proud on that occasion. By the time he had finished
he was almost as much moved as his hearers.</p>

<p>There had been, of course, interruptions, but
they had been few, and Laurie had waved them
aside. Now, at the end, both Ned and Bob
wanted many things explained to them. Thanks,
however, to his talk that afternoon with Mrs.
Deane and, later, with Polly, Laurie was in a
position to answer all questions promptly and
lucidly. When, as infrequently occurred, his
knowledge was insufficient, he answered just the
same. He grudgingly struck off ten years from
Miss Comfort’s age at Bob’s behest, but to all
other statements he clung tenaciously.</p>

<p>“Another thing I don’t understand,” said Ned,
“is why some of the folks she knows don’t give
her a home. There must be lots of people in
Orstead who would be glad to take her in.”</p>

<p>“What good would that do?” asked Laurie.
“They might give her a room to sleep in, but how
would she live? You know perfectly well that
they wouldn’t be willing to let her use their
kitchen to make her cakes and things in. And if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
she doesn’t make cake and sell it she can’t buy
food or clothes—”</p>

<p>Laurie paused, suddenly remembering that he
had neglected to mention the pathetic fact that
Miss Comfort had worn the same dress for years
and years. He wished he hadn’t forgotten that,
and he wondered if it was too late now to bring
it in.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll say it’s mighty hard luck for the
poor woman,” said Ned finally, “but I’m blessed
if I can see what any of <em>us</em> can do. If you’ve
got any silly idea in your head that Bob and I
are going to buy a house for Miss Comfort to
spend the rest of her days in—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass,” begged Laurie.</p>

<p>“All right, but why the locked door, then? And
why all the—the talk about it?”</p>

<p>“Nod’s got a scheme,” said Bob, and he
beamed trustfully at Laurie.</p>

<p>Ned grunted suspiciously. “Bet you it calls
for money,” he said.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t,” replied Laurie. “At least, only
a few pennies. The price of a telegram to Sioux
City, Iowa, and, divided among the three of us,
that won’t amount to anything, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“Sioux City, Iowa?” exclaimed Ned. “What
for? Why not send it to New York? It
wouldn’t cost nearly so much.”</p>

<p>“Because, you blithering idiot,” responded
Laurie, “this Goop fellow doesn’t live in New
York. He lives in Sioux City.”</p>

<p>“Mean you’re going to telegraph to him?”
asked Bob excitedly. “What are you going to
say?”</p>

<p>“Count me out,” said Ned. “This isn’t our
affair at all, and you’ll get yourself in trouble if
you butt in on it.”</p>

<p>Laurie viewed his brother disappointedly and
sighed. Now he would have to start all over
again! “Gee,” he said sadly, “I thought you had
a heart, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I have,” answered Ned. “And I’ve got some
common sense, too.”</p>

<p>“Sure, but now listen, will you? I talked it
all over with Mrs. Deane and Polly, and they
agreed that—well, Mrs. Deane did, anyhow—that
if Miss Comfort wouldn’t write to her brother-in-law
some one ought to do it for her. And—”</p>

<p>“Glad Polly had some sense, if you hadn’t,”
said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“Polly wasn’t there then. Now, listen, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let him tell you, Ned,” begged Bob.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I <em>am</em> listening! But I don’t hear anything
but piffle, and—”</p>

<p>“It isn’t piffle, you stubborn chump. <em>Some
one’s</em> got to do something, haven’t they? You
don’t want to see that poor old lady dumped right
out on the sidewalk, do you? At her age?
Nearly—” Laurie stifled “ninety” and substituted
“eighty.” “Gee, I supposed you’d be
<em>glad</em> to help, instead of—of throwing obstacles
in the way. Gee, supposing she was your aunt
or—or something—”</p>

<p>“She isn’t,” said Ned briefly.</p>

<p>“Well, she might be. If she was—”</p>

<p>“I guess she’s <em>somebody’s</em> aunt,” said Bob
feelingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! I’d like to help her, of course,
you idiots, but I don’t see where we have any
right to butt in and—”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m trying to explain to you,”
interrupted Laurie. “If you’ll just listen a minute—”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Ned capitulated. Two minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
after that the three boys were busy concocting
a telegram to send to Mr. Goupil in Sioux
City, Iowa. It was decided that each should compose
what he considered the proper message and
that they would subsequently write a fourth draft
comprised of the best points of each. So they
each set to work with pencil and paper and furrowed
brows, and for several minutes all was
very still in No. 16, East Hall. Having given
the matter some previous thought, Laurie naturally
finished first. Then Bob’s composition was
laid on the desk, and finally, considerably later,
Ned’s.</p>

<p>Laurie read them aloud, Bob’s first. Bob’s
was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“A. G. Goupil,<br>
<span class="padleft1">“Goupil Machinery Co.,</span><br>
<span class="padleft2">“Sioux City, Iowa.</span><br></p>

<p>“What’s the big idea turning your sister-in-law into
street at her age? You ought to be ashamed.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Gee,” laughed Laurie, “you don’t mind how
many words you use, do you?”</p>

<p>“You do it in less,” challenged Bob indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“I have. Here’s Ned’s:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sister-in-law to be turned out of home unless you
come to rescue immediately.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Sounds as though you meant your own sister-in-law,”
commented Laurie. “That’s not bad,
though.”</p>

<p>“Sounds all right to me,” said Ned. “Let’s
hear yours.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Is Miss Comfort being evicted from house by your
order? Public opinion in arms. Answer.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Huh,” said Ned, “public opinion can’t be ‘in
arms,’ you silly chump.”</p>

<p>“That’s only two words less than mine,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see if we can’t get it into ten,”
replied Laurie untroubledly. “Now then!” He
took up his pencil again. “We might say ‘Comfort’
instead of ‘Miss Comfort,’ but it doesn’t
sound quite respectful.”</p>

<p>“Leave out ‘from house,’” suggested Bob.
“He will understand that she isn’t being evicted
from the stable!”</p>

<p>“That’s so! ‘Is Miss Comfort being evicted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
by your order? Public opinion—er—’”</p>

<p>“‘Against it,’” offered Ned.</p>

<p>“‘Opposed,’” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” exclaimed Laurie, erasing and
starting a new draft. “How’s this? ‘Have you
authorized eviction aged sister-in-law? Orstead
indignant. Answer immediately.’ That ought
to fetch him! Only ten words, too!”</p>

<p>“How about sister-in-law?” asked Bob. “Will
they call it one word or three?”</p>

<p>“One, of course. Or ‘aged relative’ might do
just as well. ‘Orstead indignant’ will give him a
jolt, I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to sign it?” asked Ned
anxiously.</p>

<p>Laurie hadn’t thought of that. Bob suggested
“Friend,” but Ned reminded him that if they expected
to get a reply they’d have to give more of
an address than that. Laurie took a deep breath
and leaped the Rubicon. He signed “Laurence
S. Turner” boldly and drew a heavy mark under
it for emphasis. Ned shook his head doubtfully,
but Bob was thrilled.</p>

<p>“He will probably think you’re one of the
town’s leading citizens,” he chuckled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“Well, so I am,” answered Laurie, “in this
affair. Now we’ll go down and get it off at night-rates.”</p>

<p>“Say,” said Ned, “we’re a set of dumb-bells!
We could have sent a night-letter of fifty words
for the same price.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Laurie. “I think a
night-letter costs a little more, though, doesn’t
it? Anyway, this is more—more succinct.
It sounds more businesslike. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>They agreed that it did, and presently, a fresh
copy of the message in his pocket, Laurie led the
way from the room, followed by the others. The
languid youth who accepted the telegram at the
office appeared to hesitate over “sister-in-law,”
but he made no objection to its inclusion as one
word, and he brightened perceptibly as the sense
of the message percolated in his mind. He looked
curiously at the three boys, re-read the message,
and then shook his head incredulously.</p>

<p>“Sick ’em, Prince,” he murmured.</p>

<p>The cost of the telegram was less than Laurie
had dared hope it would be, and in the first moment
of relief he magnanimously offered to pay a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
full half. Fortunately for his purse, though, the
others insisted on sharing equally, and, the second
moment having now arrived, Laurie allowed them
to do it.</p>

<p>Returning to school, Ned was preyed on by
doubts. Now that the telegram was an accomplished
fact, he spoke dismally of the laws concerning
libel. When Laurie refused to be concerned
he wanted to know what they were to do
if Mr. Goupil wired back that he had authorized
Miss Comfort’s eviction. Laurie wasn’t prepared
to answer that question. “We’ll cross
that bridge when we come to it,” he replied with
dignity.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Laurie didn’t intend to
do anything in such a case. He had saved his
face, and that was sufficient. After this he meant
to refrain from too much talking and keep out
of affairs that didn’t concern him. Unfortunately,
as he was to discover, it is frequently
easier to start than it is to stop, and to make
good resolutions than to follow them!</p>

<p>As he secretly considered the episode ended,
Laurie would have put Miss Comfort and Mr. A.
G. Goupil completely out of his mind for the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of the evening if Ned hadn’t insisted on speculating
as to the effect of the telegram on the addressee.
Ned just couldn’t seem to let the subject
alone. Laurie became very much bored, and
when Ned, later, came out with the brilliant suggestion
of having Miss Comfort added to the
school faculty as professor of pastry Laurie
threw a book at him.</p>

<p>The following morning Kewpie was absolutely
exasperating when they met beside the gymnasium.
He had brought his precious book with
him and insisted on pausing between pitches
to study diagrams and directions, occasioning
long waits and leaving Laurie with nothing to do
save indulge in feeble sarcasms that affected
Kewpie no whit. Kewpie was struggling with
what he earnestly told Laurie was an out-drop.
Laurie sarcastically replied that Kewpie was at
liberty to call it anything he pleased, out-drop,
floater, in-shoot, or fade-away; they all looked
the same to him when Kewpie pitched ’em!
Kewpie looked almost hurt, and Laurie recalled
Polly’s injunction not to discourage the aspirant
for pitching honors, and so presently told Kewpie
that one of his offerings “looked pretty good.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
After that Kewpie cheered up a lot and pitched
a ball high over the back-stop.</p>

<p>All that day Laurie looked for a telegram. It
was, he thought, inconceivable that the Goop guy,
as he privately called Mr. A. G. Goupil, should delay
in answering such a communication, and when,
after school was over for the day, no telegram
had been delivered at East Hall, he hurried down
to the telegraph office and made inquiries. The
man in charge, who was not the one who had
been on duty the evening before, went to a deal
of trouble before informing Laurie that no message
had been received. Going back, Laurie pondered.
It might mean that Mr. Goupil had chosen
to communicate with his lawyer instead of him,
Laurie. Or it might mean that Mr. Goupil was
taking time to consider the matter. Laurie dismissed
the business from his mind, and, although
well ahead of time, went over to the gymnasium
and leisurely donned his baseball togs. There
had been talk of getting out on the field to-day, but
the turf was still a little too soft.</p>

<p>In the baseball cage four other early arrivals
were on hand; Nate Beedle, Hillman’s first-choice
pitcher, Captain Dave Brewster, third baseman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Gordon Simkins, in-field candidate, and Elkins
Thurston. The last two were passing, while
Beedle and Brewster sat on the floor with their
backs against the wire.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nod!” greeted Nate. “Hear you’ve
started a kindergarten for pitchers, sonny.”</p>

<p>Nate was a nice chap, and Nod didn’t mind
being “ragged” by him a bit. “Yes, that’s so,”
Laurie agreed. “Want to join?”</p>

<p>The others laughed; all save Elk. Elk, tossing
the ball back to Simkins, sneered, “The way I
got it, Proudtree’s trying to teach Turner how to
catch!”</p>

<p>“Fact is,” replied Laurie, “it’s sort of mutual.
Kewpie’s improving his pitching, and I’m improving
my catching.”</p>

<p>“Can he pitch at all?” asked Dave Brewster.</p>

<p>“Kewpie? Well, he hasn’t much just now,
but—”</p>

<p>“But you’re teaching him the trick, eh?”
jeered Elk. “Say, Nate, you’d better watch out
or you’ll lose your job.”</p>

<p>Nate laughed good-naturedly. “That’s right.
I’ll say one thing, though. If Kewpie could
pitch the way he can play center I’d be worried.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Does he think he can get on the squad, Nod?”</p>

<p>“Guess he’d like to.”</p>

<p>“He’s got a swell chance,” said Elk.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Laurie. “They
took you on.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Don’t get fresh, youngster. I
suppose you think you’ve got such a pull with
Pinky that he’ll take on any fellow you recommend.
Say, Nate, can’t you just see Proudtree
running bases?” And Elk laughed vociferously.</p>

<p>Laurie, just at present inclined to resent anything
that Elk said, merely on general principles,
found cause for added resentment now. Kewpie
was both friend and pupil, and consequently disparagement
of Kewpie was disparagement of
him. Simkins’s remark that Kewpie had shown
pretty good speed on the football field was cut
into by Laurie with:</p>

<p>“He isn’t out to become a sprinter, Elk. He’s
going to be a pitcher. You don’t expect a pitcher
to be much of a hand on the bases. As for his
chance of getting on the squad, well, when I get
through with him I guess he can have a place if
he wants it.”</p>

<p>“When you— Oh, my sainted aunt!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Elk. “When you get through with him! What
do you know about pitching, I’d like to know?
You’re a swell teacher, you are! You never
caught behind the plate until two or three weeks
ago.”</p>

<p>“What of it? That doesn’t prevent me from
knowing a natural-born pitcher when I see him.
And if—”</p>

<p>“Natural-born pitcher! Kewpie Proudtree?
Don’t make me laugh! I’ll bet he can’t pitch a
straight ball!”</p>

<p>“Can’t, eh? Listen, Elk. Kewpie’s a better
pitcher right now than you are a catcher. If he
wasn’t I wouldn’t bother with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! He can’t pitch and you can’t teach
him, kid. And as for catching, if I dropped every
ball that comes over I wouldn’t be shooting my
mouth off, you fresh guy!”</p>

<p>“I get my glove on ’em, and that’s more than
you do, Elk, old son. And if you think I don’t
know what I’m talking about when I say that
Kewpie’s got the making of a pitcher, why, you
just keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Sure! You’re going to have him on the
squad next week, I suppose!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“No, not next week, but I’ll tell you one thing.
He will be pitching for this team before the season’s
over!”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” It was a chorus of blank incredulity.
Then there was laughter, through which
struggled Nate’s voice saying, “Nod, you’re as
crazy as a coot!” The burst of merriment acted
on Laurie somewhat like a wet sponge on the face
of a sleeper. He awoke suddenly to the enormity
of his assertion, and caution urged him to prompt
retraction, or, at least, compromise. But there
was Elk Thurston grinning and sneering, his very
attitude a challenge. Laurie swallowed hard and
summoned a smile of careless ease to his countenance.</p>

<p>“You heard what I said,” he remarked calmly.</p>

<p>Then Coach Mulford came in, and the die was
cast. Laurie waved a nonchalant hand to Dave
Brewster. In appearance he looked as care-free
and untroubled as any person there, but to himself
he was saying bitterly, “There, you poor
fish, you’ve been and gone and done it again!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>POLLY APPROVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Practice over, Laurie set out to find Ned.
He was very low in his mind, was Laurie,
and he wanted comfort in the worst way. But
Ned wasn’t in the room. The door of No. 15,
across the corridor, was half ajar, and through it
issued the voice of Kewpie. “That you, Nid?”
inquired Kewpie. “Say, come in here. I’ve—”</p>

<p>“No!” replied Laurie emphatically as he hurried,
toward the stairs. Kewpie Proudtree was
the last person in the whole world he wanted to
hold converse with just then. In fact, he wasn’t
sure that he would be able to control himself in
Kewpie’s presence. Murder, he reflected gloomily,
had been committed for less cause than he
had!</p>

<p>He set out toward the Widow Deane’s, going
the long way around, since he had no heart for
Bob Starling’s questions and surmises regarding
Mr. A. G. Goupil. He had so thoroughly forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
that flinty-hearted person that he had not
even looked on the table in No. 16 to see if the
telegram had arrived, and only the thought of encountering
Bob had reminded him of it. Turning
into Garden Street, he heard some one call:
“Oh, Ned! Oo-ee!” It was no new thing to be
mistaken for Ned. During the first two months,
or thereabouts, of their stay at Hillman’s, he and
Ned had been daily, hourly, almost constantly
mistaken one for the other, and even to this moment
such mistakes were not uncommon, which,
considering the fact that the twins were as alike
as two peas, was not unnatural. He wasn’t Ned,
but he turned to see who was calling. It proved
to be Mae Ferrand. She was on the opposite side
of the street waving to him. Laurie crossed with
little enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said. “I’m looking for him, too,
Mae.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Laurie!” she exclaimed. “I do wish
you boys wouldn’t dress just alike!”</p>

<p>“We don’t,” said Laurie somberly. “He’s
wearing brown stockings, and I’m wearing
green.” He looked down at them. “Sort of
green, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Just as though any one could tell you by
that,” laughed Mae. “Are you going to
Polly’s?”</p>

<p>Laurie acknowledged that he was, and they went
on together. “Isn’t it too bad about that poor,
dear little Miss Comfort?” asked Mae. “Polly
told you, didn’t she?”</p>

<p>Laurie nodded. “Yes,” he answered. “Yes,
it is too bad. At her age, too. Eighty-something,
isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, of course not! The idea! She
can’t be a day over sixty-five.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Laurie sounded a trifle disappointed.
“Well, that’s different, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is,” agreed Mae without,
however, quite getting his point of view, “but
it doesn’t make it much easier for her, I guess.”</p>

<p>“N-no.” Laurie was acquiring something
close to distaste for the subject. “Well, something
may turn up,” he added vaguely, “before
the first of the month.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Mae. But she didn’t sound
hopeful. Laurie was glad when she changed the
subject with her next remark, although he could
have chosen a more welcome one: “Polly says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
that the—the conspiracy is working just beautifully,
Laurie. She says that Kewpie Proudtree
is quite like another boy the last day or two. Is
he doing any better with his pitching?”</p>

<p>Laurie turned and regarded her balefully.
“Better? No, and he never will,” he answered
disgustedly. “Why that poor prune couldn’t
pitch ball if—if—” He stopped, suddenly recalling
his statements made in the cage a scant hour
and a half since. He felt rather confused. Mae
nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, I think it’s darling of you to take so
much trouble with him,” she said. “Sometimes I
think that friendship means so much more with
boys than it does with girls.”</p>

<p>“Friendship!” blurted Laurie.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, don’t you call it friendship?
Every one knows what great pals you and Kewpie
have been all winter. I think it’s perfectly
lovely!”</p>

<p>“Huh,” growled Laurie.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, what is the matter with
you to-day?” asked Mae concernedly. “You’re—you’re
awfully funny!”</p>

<p>Laurie summoned a mirthless and hollow laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
“I’m all right,” he replied, “only I—I’ve got a
lot of things to think of just now, and—”</p>

<p>Further explanation was spared him, for just
then they reached the shop and Laurie opened
the door with a sigh of relief. Ned was there,
and so were Polly and Mrs. Deane. Laurie morosely
declined the offer of a soda, slung himself
to a counter, met the surprised and mildly disapproving
gaze of the Widow, and got down again.
The talk, interrupted by their arrival, began once
more. Of course it was about Miss Comfort.
(Mrs. Deane had been to see her that forenoon.)
She hadn’t heard again from the lawyer or from
her brother-in-law, and she had begun to pack her
things. Laurie felt Ned’s gaze on him and
turned. Ned’s look was inquiring. Laurie
didn’t know what he meant by it, and frowned
his perplexity. Ned worked around to him and
whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>“Did it come? Did you get it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Get what?”</p>

<p>“Shut up! The telegram, you chump!”</p>

<p>“Oh! No, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“You don’t <em>think</em>—” began Ned in impatient
sibilation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“What are you two whispering about?” inquired
Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” answered Ned airily.</p>

<p>“Ned Turner, don’t tell fibs,” said Polly
severely. “There’s something going on that we
don’t know about, Mae. Mama’s in on it, too.
I can tell. She can no more hide a secret than
she can fly. And I don’t think,” ended Polly with
deep pathos, “that it’s very nice of you to have
a secret from Mae and me.”</p>

<p>Ned looked concerned and apologetic. He
viewed Laurie inquiringly. “Shall we tell
them?” he asked. Laurie shrugged.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” he answered moodily.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, if you don’t <em>want</em> us to know,”
began Polly very haughtily. Laurie managed a
most winning smile.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” he assured her. “I—I was
going to tell you, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Polly didn’t look wholly convinced, but,
“Well?” she said. “Go on and tell, then.”
Laurie waved toward Ned.</p>

<p>“Let him do it,” he said.</p>

<p>So Ned confessed about the telegram to Mr.
Goupil, taking rather more credit to himself than,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
perhaps, the facts warranted—something that
might have brought a protest from Laurie had
that youth been any longer interested in what
to him seemed now a closed incident. Polly exclaimed
applaudingly; Mae clapped her hands;
and Mrs. Deane, proud of the fact that for once in
her life she had managed, if only for a few short
hours, to keep something secret from her
daughter, beamed. Then praise was fairly
lavished on Laurie and Ned, the former receiving
the lion’s share, since the brilliant idea had
been born in his stupendous brain. Laurie
looked decidedly bored, and the feminine portion
of the assembly credited his expression to modesty.</p>

<p>“Oh, Laurie,” exclaimed Polly, “I think you’re
perfectly wonderful! Don’t you, Mae?”</p>

<p>Mae was enthusiastically affirmative.</p>

<p>“It was just the one absolutely practical thing
to do,” continued Polly. “And I don’t see how
Mr. Gou—Gou—whatever his name is—will dare
to go on with his disgusting plan, do you? If
that telegram doesn’t make him perfectly
ashamed of himself, it—it—well, it ought
to!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“Sort of funny, though,” said Ned, “that he
hasn’t answered before this. If he doesn’t answer
at all—well, do you think we ought to send
him another, Laurie?”</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head. “No good,” he said
briefly.</p>

<p>“Oh, but he will answer it,” declared Polly.
“Why, he’d simply <em>have</em> to! His own self-respect
would—would demand it!”</p>

<p>“Of course!” agreed Mae. “Maybe there’s a
telegram waiting for you now, Laurie.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.” Laurie spoke with more animation.
“Let’s go and see, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about it to Miss Comfort,”
observed Mrs. Deane in the tone of one asking
commendation.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you mustn’t,” said Polly. “If—if
nothing came of it, after all, she’d be <em>too</em> disappointed.
Laurie, if Mr. Whatshisname still insists
on—on things going ahead as they are going,
what will you do then?”</p>

<p>“Me?” Laurie regarded her unemotionally.
Then he shrugged. “Why, I guess that would
settle it, wouldn’t it? Isn’t anything more I
<em>could</em> do, is there? Or any of us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Laurie!” exclaimed Mae in vast disappointment.
Polly, though, only laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Mae,” she said. “Of course
he’s only fooling. You ought to know Laurie
well enough to know that he isn’t going to give
up as easily as all that. I’ll just bet you anything
he knows this very minute what he means
to do. Only he doesn’t want to tell us yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, either,” protested Laurie vehemently.
“Look here, this isn’t any affair of
mine, and—and—”</p>

<p>“Just what I told him,” said Mrs. Deane
agreeably. “I think he’s been very nice to take
such an interest and so much trouble, but I’m
sure he can’t be expected to do any more,
Polly.”</p>

<p>Polly smiled serenely. She shared the smile
between her mother and a disquieted Laurie.
Then she slipped an arm around Mae and gave
her a squeeze. “We know, don’t we, Mae?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Laurie stared helplessly for a moment. Then
he seized Ned by the arm and dragged him toward
the door. “Come on,” he said despairingly.
“Come on home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“Say,” demanded Ned, once they were on the
street, “what in the world’s the matter with
you?”</p>

<p>“Matter with me?” repeated Laurie a trifle
wildly. “The matter with me is that I talk too
blamed much! That’s the matter with me!
The matter with me—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” agreed Ned soothingly, “yes, yes,
old-timer. But what’s the present difficulty?
Of course they don’t really expect us to find a
home for Miss Comfort, if that’s what’s biting
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should hope not! But—but, listen,
Neddie. Do you think Kewpie knows enough
about pitching to ever amount to a hill of beans?
Do you think that, if he practised like anything
all spring, he could—could get on the team?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, of course not,” replied Ned calmly.
“Haven’t you said so yourself a dozen times?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes, and now I’ve gone and said he
could!”</p>

<p>“Who could? Could what?”</p>

<p>“Kewpie. Be a pitcher and get on the team.”</p>

<p>“Are you plumb loco?” asked Ned in astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“No.” Laurie shook his head mournfully.
“No, it isn’t that. I—I just talk too blamed
much.”</p>

<p>“Well, who have you been talking to now?
Get it off your chest, partner.”</p>

<p>So Laurie told him. The narrative lasted until
they had reached their room, and after, and
when, at last, Laurie ended his doleful tale Ned
looked at him in silence for a long, long moment.
Finally, “You half-portion of nothing!” breathed
Ned pityingly. “You—you poor fish!”</p>

<p>“Well, what could I do?” asked Laurie. “I
wasn’t going to let Elk make me look like a
fool.”</p>

<p>“Huh! What do you think you look like now?”</p>

<p>Laurie began to prepare for supper without
replying. He acted as if chastened and worried.
Ned watched him for a minute in frowning perplexity.
At last the frown vanished. “Well,
what are you going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>Laurie shrugged. “How do I know? I did
think that maybe somehow or other Kewpie could
learn to pitch, but I guess you’re right about
him. He never could.”</p>

<p>“No, but he’s got to!” was Ned’s astounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
answer. “We’ve got to see that he does, Laurie.
You’ve said you were going to make a pitcher of
him—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t actually say <em>I</em> was going to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, some one. You’ve said he was going
to pitch on the team this season. You might as
well have said that I was going to be made President.
But you said it and, by heck, you’ve got
to make good or perish in the attempt. The
honor of the Turners—”</p>

<p>“Looks to me like the honor of the Turners
is going to get an awful jolt,” murmured Laurie
despondently. “Making a pitcher out of Kewpie—
Gee, Ned, the fellow who made a purse out of
a pig’s ear had a snap!”</p>

<p>“It’s got to be done,” reiterated Ned firmly.
“After supper we’ll decide how. Hold on,
though! We don’t actually have to have him a
real pitcher, son. All we have to do is to get him
on the team just once, even if it’s only for two
minutes, don’t you see?” Ned’s tone was triumphant.</p>

<p>“Yes, but how can we do that if he doesn’t
know how to pitch? I don’t see that that’s going
to make it any easier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe, maybe not. Anyhow, it helps.
There might be some way of faking him on there.
Well, we’ve got nearly three months to do it in,
Laurie, so cheer up. Let’s go and eat. A truce
to all trouble! The bell rings for supper—”</p>

<p>“Of cold meat as chewy as Indian rupper!”
completed Laurie.</p>

<p>“Quitter!” laughed Ned, pushing him through
the door.</p>

<small>KEWPIE AGREES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Kewpie!”</p>

<p>“Yeah?”</p>

<p>“Come on over here!” It was Laurie calling
from the doorway of No. 16. The door across
the corridor opened, and the somewhat sleepy
countenance of Kewpie peered forth inquiringly.
The hour was 9:40.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Kewpie. “I’m
just going to bed. I’m tired, Nod.”</p>

<p>“You come over here,” was the stern, inexorable
answer. “Ned and I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, gosh, I tell you I’m sleepy,” muttered
Kewpie, but he crossed the hall and followed
Laurie into No. 16. Kewpie was chastely clad
in a suit of out-size pajamas, which were white
with a broad blue stripe at short intervals. Kewpie
in night attire looked about half again as
large as he did when more or less confined in
street costume. Laurie thrust the visitor into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
arm-chair. Kewpie subsided with a long sigh
and blinked wonderingly, first at Nid and then
at the determined Nod. Then he placed a large
and pudgy hand in the neighborhood of his face
and yawned cavernously.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows?” he inquired.
“What are you looking at me like that
for?”</p>

<p>“Kewpie,” said Ned, “do you honestly think
you can ever learn to pitch?”</p>

<p>“What!” Kewpie woke up a trifle. “I can
pitch right now. Who says I can’t?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Laurie emphatically. “You can
pitch now just about as well as a toad can fly.
What we want to know is whether, if you practise
hard and keep at it, you can learn.”</p>

<p>Kewpie looked hurt. “Say, what’s the matter
with my drop-ball?” he asked indignantly. “I
suppose you think you could hit that, eh? Well,
I’d like to see you try it.”</p>

<p>“Cut out the bunk, Kewpie,” said Ned sternly.
“We’re talking business now. You know plaguey
well you wouldn’t last ten seconds against a batter,
the way you’re pitching now. Laurie says
you’ve got a fair drop, when you get it right,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and that’s all you have got. You haven’t—haven’t—
What is it he hasn’t got, Laurie?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got anything except that drop.
He can’t pitch a straight ball with any speed—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. Any one can hit the fast
ones.”</p>

<p>“And he hasn’t a curve to his name. About
all he has got is a colossal nerve.”</p>

<p>“Nerve yourself,” replied Kewpie. “I don’t
pretend to be a Joe Bush, or—or—”</p>

<p>“Can you learn?” demanded Ned. “If Laurie
and I help every way we know how, if you study
that book of yours, if you practise hard every
day for—for two months, say, will you be able
to pitch decently at the end of that time?”</p>

<p>Kewpie was plainly puzzled by this sudden
and intense interest in him; puzzled and a trifle
suspicious. “What do you want to know for?”
he asked slowly.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Answer the question.” Ned
was very stern.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’d be able to pitch after two months.
Bet you I’d have everything there is.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Ned. “Here’s the dope.
Laurie and Elk Thurston and Nate Beedle and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
two or three more were talking in the gym this
afternoon, and Elk said you were no good and
never would be able to pitch, and—”</p>

<p>“Elk!” interrupted Kewpie contemptuously.
“He’s just a big blow-hard, a bluff, a—”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. Laurie said you <em>could</em>
pitch and that before the season was over you’d
be pitching on the nine. Get that?”</p>

<p>Kewpie nodded, glancing from one to the other
of the twins, but he seemed at a loss for words.
Finally, though, he asked awedly, “Gosh, Nod,
did you tell ’em that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, like a blamed idiot I did! I guess I had
a brain-storm or something. Well, never mind
that now. What do <em>you</em> say?”</p>

<p>“Me?” Kewpie cleared his throat. “Well,
now, look here, I never told you I could pitch on
the team, did I?”</p>

<p>“If you didn’t you might just as well have,”
answered Laurie impatiently. “You’ve been
cracking yourself up for a month. Now, what
Ned and I want to know—”</p>

<p>“Well, but hold on! How would I get to pitch,
with Nate Beedle and two or three others there?
Gosh, those sharks have been at it for years!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“Never you mind how,” said Ned sharply.
“That’s not the question. Laurie’s gone and
put himself in a hole, and you’ve got to help pull
him out. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>Kewpie was again silent for a moment. Then
he nodded. “Sure,” he said dubiously. “I’ll
do what I can, but—”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any ‘buts,’” declared Ned.
“If you’ll take hold seriously and do your best
and learn to pitch—well, fairly decently, Kewpie,
Laurie and I’ll look after the rest of it. We’ll
see that you get your chance somehow with the
team.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do it?” asked Kewpie.</p>

<p>Ned shrugged. “Don’t know yet. That’ll
come later. Now, what do you say? Will you
be a game sport and buckle into it, or are you
going to throw us down? You’ll have to quit
bluffing about what you can do and work like the
dickens, Kewpie. You’ll have to quit eating
sweet stuff and starchy things and get rid of about
ten pounds, too. Well?”</p>

<p>Kewpie looked solemnly back at Ned for an instant.
Then he nodded shortly. “I’ll do it,”
he said soberly. “Let’s go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>The next day, which was a Saturday, the baseball
candidates forsook the gymnasium and went
out on the field. The ground was still soft in
spots, and the diamond was not used. There was
a long session at the batting-net and plenty of
fielding work to follow, and of course, the pitching
staff unlimbered and “shot ’em over” for awhile.
Beedle, Pemberton, and Croft comprised the staff
at present, with two or three aspirants applying
for membership. George Pemberton fell to
Laurie’s share. Pemberton was not so good as
Nate Beedle, but he had done good work for the
team last year and he was a “comer.” Laurie,
taking Pemberton’s shoots in his big mitten, for
the first time since he had been transferred from
the out-field to a position behind the plate,
watched his pitcher’s work. Before this, Laurie
had concerned himself wholly with the ball. Now
he gave attention to the behavior of Pemberton,
studying the latter’s stand, his wind-up, the way
his body and pitching arm came forward, the way
the ball left his hand. More than once Laurie
became so engrossed with the pitcher that the
ball got by him entirely. He even tried to discern
how Pemberton placed his fingers around the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
sphere in order to pitch that famous slow one of
his that had foiled the best batsmen of the enemy
last spring. But at the distance Laurie couldn’t
get it.</p>

<p>Pemberton was eighteen, tall, rather thin,
rather awkward until he stepped into the box
and took a baseball in his capable hand. After
that he was as easy and graceful as a tiger. The
difference between Pemberton’s smooth wind-up
and delivery and Kewpie’s laborious and jerky
performance brought Laurie a sigh of despair.
As he stopped a high one with his mitt and quite
dexterously plucked it from the air with his right
hand, Laurie was more than ever convinced that
the campaign on which he and Ned and Kewpie
had embarked last evening so grimly and determinedly
was foredoomed to failure. Gee! Kewpie
would never be able to pitch like George Pemberton
if he lived to be a hundred years old and
practised twenty-four hours a day! Laurie almost
wished that he had been born tongue-tied!
Later, returning to the gymnasium, Laurie
ranged himself beside Pemberton. He had provided
himself with a ball, and now he offered it
to the pitcher. “Say, George, show me how you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
hold it for that floater of yours, will you?” he
said.</p>

<p>Pemberton took the ball good-naturedly enough.
“What are you trying to do, Nod?” he asked.
“Get my job away from me? Well, here’s the
way I hold it.” He placed his long fingers about
the ball with careful regard for the seams. “But
holding it isn’t more than half of it, Nod. You
see, you’ve got to flip it away just right. Your
thumb puts the drag on it, see? When you let go
of it it starts away like this.” Pemberton swung
his arm through slowly and let the ball trickle
from his hand. Laurie recovered it from a few
paces away and stared at it in puzzled fashion.
He guessed he wouldn’t be able to learn much
about pitching that way. Pemberton continued
his explanation carelessly. “You see, you’ve
got to start it off with the right spin. That’s
what keeps it up after a straight ball would begin
to drop. Now you take the ‘fade-away.’ I can’t
pitch it, but I know how it’s done. You start
it like this.”</p>

<p>Laurie listened and looked on with only perfunctory
interest. It wasn’t any use, he decided.
Learning Pemberton’s stuff and teaching it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Kewpie was beyond his abilities. Besides, when
he came to think about it, it didn’t seem quite
fair. It was too much like stealing another fellow’s
patent. Of course there wasn’t more than
one chance in ten that Kewpie would progress to
the stage where he might burst on the Hillman’s
baseball firmament as a rival to Pemberton,
but ... just the same.... The next time Pemberton
let the ball go Laurie picked it up and
dropped it in his pocket.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, saw Ned and Laurie
walking toward the Widow Deane’s shortly after
dinner was over. It had become a custom to go
for a walk on Sunday afternoons, when the
weather was gracious, with Polly and Mae and,
sometimes, Bob Starling or some of the other
fellows. To-day, however, there were indications
that a late dinner was still going on at the Starlings’,
and the twins didn’t stop for Bob. It had
rained during the night but a warm sun had long
since removed all signs of it. Along the streets
bordering School Park doors and windows were
open to the spring-like air. In the park the few
benches were occupied, and, beyond, in the paved
yard of the high school, some small youths were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
indulging somewhat noisily in an amusement suspiciously
like baseball. Of course it couldn’t be
baseball, as Laurie pointed out, since the town
laws sternly forbade that game on Sundays. At
the further corner of Pine Street a small white
house with faded brown shutters stood sedately
behind a leafless and overgrown hedge of lilac.
The twins viewed the house with new interest, for
it was there that Miss Comfort lived. Ned
thought that through a gap in the hedge he had
glimpsed a face behind one of the front windows.</p>

<p>“Reckon this is her last Sunday in the old
home,” observed Ned. It sounded flippant, and
probably he had meant that it should, but inside
him he felt very sorry for the little old lady. It
was not much of a house, as houses went even in
Orstead, but it was home to Miss Comfort, and
Ned suddenly felt the pathos of the impending
departure.</p>

<p>Laurie grunted assent as they turned the corner
toward the little blue painted shop. “Guess
we aren’t going to hear from the Goop,” he said.
“It’s three days now.”</p>

<p>“We—ell, he might be away or something,”
answered Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” said Laurie. “He didn’t
answer Miss Comfort’s letter, and I guess he
isn’t going to answer our telegram. The old
skinflint,” he added as an afterthought.</p>

<small>THE AFTERNOON CALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Which way?” asked Ned as, a few minutes
later, they went through the gate.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down to the river and along the
road and see all the booful automobiles,” said
Laurie.</p>

<p>“It’s not my idea of a pleasant walk,” returned
Ned, “to get entirely covered with dust and then
run over!”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to walk,” announced Polly.
“Anyway, not yet. We’re going this way.”
She and Mae turned toward School Park.</p>

<p>“Not going to walk?” exclaimed Laurie.
“What are we going to do? Polly, don’t tell me
you’ve gone and bought an automobile!”</p>

<p>“We’re going calling,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” protested Ned. “Calling, did you
say? Not much, Polly! At least, I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Now, Ned Turner—” began Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind him,” broke in Laurie. “I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
go calling with you, Polly. I just love to go calling.
Have you any one specially in mind? Or
shall we just take them as they come?”</p>

<p>They were crossing the street now diagonally,
Polly and Mae in the lead. Laurie was smoothing
his hair and settling his tie smirkingly. Ned
looked rebellious. “Who are we going to call
on?” he demanded dejectedly.</p>

<p>“You’ll know soon enough,” laughed Polly.
And he did, for the next instant she had pushed
open a little gate between the lilac hedges and
was leading the way up the short path to Miss
Comfort’s door.</p>

<p>“Gee!” murmured Laurie. But he and Ned
followed obediently and stared questioningly at
Polly while somewhere at the rear of the little
house, a bell jangled in response to her tug at the
brown crockery knob. “What’s the big idea?”
whispered Laurie to Mae, who was nearest. But
Mae only shook her head. And then, with such
promptitude as to suggest to Ned that he had
not just imagined that face at the front window,
the door opened, and Miss Comfort was giving
them welcome. There were introductions in the
small hall, during which Ned trod on Laurie’s foot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and Laurie pushed Mae into an umbrella-stand
which had once been a length of drain-pipe and
which now bore a faded design of cat-o’-nine-tails
and swallows; and then, somehow, they were all
seated in the front parlor, Laurie, who had neglected
in the confusion to leave his cap in the hall,
trying to stuff it into a side pocket.</p>

<p>The room was not over-furnished. There was
a walnut sofa covered with faded green rep across
one corner, a marble-topped walnut table between
the two front windows, a bookcase midway of the
inner wall, a number of straight chairs placed
formally along the sides of the room, and an easy-chair
at each window. There were also two foot-stools
covered with crewel work, one of which
Ned narrowly escaped, and a brightly hued Brussels
carpet. A fireplace, surmounted by a white
marble shelf, was blankly, inexorably closed by
a glossy black sheet of iron. Two gilt candelabra
adorned the ends of the mantel, and a black
marble clock, whose stumpy hands had stopped
at twelve minutes to nine on some long-past day,
stood squarely in the center. There was a purple
and green square of embroidery on the table and
a few books of unexciting appearance. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
was spotlessly clean, immaculately neat,
depressingly orderly.</p>

<p>Polly and Mae, as usual, crowded into one of
the easy-chairs, and Miss Comfort sat erectly in
the other. Miss Comfort proved to be small and
rather thin, with lightish hair that wasn’t brown
and wasn’t white. She had small, delicate features
and dark eyes that remained very bright
and clear. Miss Comfort might be nearly seventy,
as Polly had stated, but there was something
youthful in her pleasant face, her quick
movements, and her thin, soft voice. Laurie was
receiving these impressions when that thin, soft
voice pronounced his name and he discovered
that his hostess had turned from the girls and
was looking toward him, her head pushed forward
a little as if, despite their brightness, her eyes
were not as serviceable as they had been.</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurie,” Miss Comfort was saying, “I
want to thank you for your interest in my affairs.
I do think it was extremely kind of you to send
that telegram to my brother-in-law. Although I
am convinced that nothing will come of it, I assure
you that I appreciate your helpfulness.”</p>

<p>It was rather a precise and formal little speech,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and it is probable that Miss Comfort had prepared
it in advance of the occasion. It left
Laurie surprised and sputtering.</p>

<p>“But—but—why, that’s all right—if you
mean—”</p>

<p>Polly came to his rescue: “It was mama who
told, Laurie. She really didn’t mean to, but if
you knew her as well as I do you’d know that she
simply can’t keep a secret, no matter how hard
she tried.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Laurie. “Well, you don’t need to
thank me—us a bit, Miss Comfort. I—we were
mighty glad to do anything we could, and we wish
there was more we might do. I guess Polly’s
told you that that—er—that your brother-in-law
hasn’t answered yet.”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort nodded. “Yes, and I’m not surprised.
Mr. Goupil is a very busy man, I suppose,
and I dare say he hasn’t time to—to look
after all matters himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me—” began Laurie indignantly.</p>

<p>“But she hasn’t,” interrupted Ned warningly.
“I guess what Laurie was going to say, Miss
Comfort, is that he—that is, we—both of—neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of us—” Laurie was smiling enjoyably—“can
understand how your brother-in-law could act
so—so—”</p>

<p>“Rotten,” supplied the irrepressible Laurie.</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Miss Comfort. “Perhaps I
can explain a little. You might say that Mr.
Goupil and I are strangers. Yes, that is scarcely
an exaggeration. My sister Amanda met him in
New Jersey fourteen years ago when she was
teaching school there. Amanda was much
younger than I and—and impulsive. I knew
nothing about Mr. Goupil until she wrote to me
from Chicago saying that she was married and on
her way west with her husband. I was dreadfully
surprised, as you can well understand, for
Amanda was—” Miss Comfort hesitated, coughed
and continued—“was almost fifty years of age,
and I had never thought of her becoming married.
In my surprise, I fear that my letter to her was
not—well, quite as sympathetic as it should have
been. I suppose I showed her that I was a little
bit hurt because she had not confided in me earlier.
That was most unfortunate, because it led to a—a
misunderstanding. I tried very hard to atone,
but she never forgave me, and after two years she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
stopped answering my letters.” Miss Comfort
was silent a moment, gazing down at the thin
hands folded in her lap. “I fear,” she went on
at length, “Amanda gathered the impression that
I didn’t approve of her husband. Well, I don’t
suppose I did. I mean that I didn’t approve of
him for her. You see, he was younger than
Amanda by several years, and then he was a
foreigner.”</p>

<p>“A foreigner!” exclaimed Polly. “Why, I
didn’t know that, Miss Comfort.”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort nodded. “Yes, he was a Frenchman,
Polly. Of course there are undoubtedly
many most estimable French gentlemen, but it
did seem to me that if Amanda <em>had</em> to marry she
might have found a man of her own race.” Miss
Comfort sighed and then she laughed apologetically.
“I don’t know why I’m telling you all
this. Oh, yes, I was trying to explain about Mr.
Goupil, wasn’t I? Well, you see, after Amanda
was married I never saw either her or her husband.
They lived in Chicago a year or so and
then moved further west, and after that I lost
all trace of them until I received word lately of
Amanda’s death. After that came this letter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
from the lawyer about the house. Maybe, you
see, Mr. Goupil doesn’t feel very kindly toward
me, and if he doesn’t I don’t suppose I should
blame him one bit.”</p>

<p>“This house belongs to him now?” asked
Laurie.</p>

<p>“Yes. My mother left a will that gave everything
to Amanda, but allowed me the use of this
place until Amanda’s death. Of course mother
never meant it the way she wrote it. She just
got a little mixed up, and as she didn’t employ
a lawyer to do it for her, why, it stood just as she
wrote it. I’ve often wondered,” added Miss
Comfort, wrinkling her forehead, “what she <em>did</em>
mean. I suppose she meant me to live here until
my death, and not Amanda’s.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you could break a will like that,”
declared Laurie eagerly.</p>

<p>“So Mr. Whipple told me,” responded Miss
Comfort. “He was the lawyer. He’s dead now.
But I didn’t like to do it. It seemed kind of—of
disrespectful to mother. Besides, I never had
any suspicion that I would outlast poor Amanda.”</p>

<p>In the ensuing silence Polly and Mae gazed
sympathetically at Miss Comfort, who, smoothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
the old black dress over her knees, appeared lost
in her thoughts. Finally:</p>

<p>“Well,” began Laurie. Then he stopped,
cleared his throat, and said: “Look here, Miss
Comfort, I’d like to ask you— It may sound
cheeky— Well, what I mean is, haven’t you—that
is, are you—” Laurie’s cheeks reddened as
he floundered on. “Haven’t you any—any
means at all? Maybe it’s none of my business—”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Laurie, I haven’t,” replied Miss
Comfort quietly. “There wasn’t ever much
money after my father died, and mother’s will
left what there was to Amanda. That was just
as it should have been, for as long as I had this
house I was quite all right.” She smiled gently.
“But, land sakes, I don’t want you young folks
to trouble your heads about me and my affairs.
Troubles aren’t for the young, Mr. Laurie.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” was the dogged response,
“but—but something—somebody— It doesn’t
seem right for you to have to go to—to that
place!”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know,” said Miss Comfort
thoughtfully. “I guess lots of perfectly respectable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
folks have gone to the poor-farm. I dare say
there’s no disgrace. And they do say that the—the
institution is conducted very nicely. No
doubt I’ll be quite comfortable there. And—and
it isn’t as though I’d have to stay very
long.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Ned relievedly, “then you
expect to—” But Polly interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Comfort,” cried Polly indignantly,
“don’t you talk like that! Why, goodness
gracious, you aren’t old at all! The—the
idea!”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” said Mae warmly. “The
idea!”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort chuckled softly. “Well, I ain’t
helpless yet, I know, Polly, but I’m—” she
coughed daintily— “I’m getting along in years,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” exploded Laurie, “there ought
to be some place in this town where you could go.
Wouldn’t you a whole lot rather live in a—a—”
he had started to say “barn,” but changed it
to—“a—a shed than go to that poor-farm
place?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I don’t know but what I would,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
said Miss Comfort, “as long as it had a roof and
I could go on with my work. But I’m afraid I
couldn’t even pay the rent for a shed, Mr. Laurie.
Now I ain’t going to let you talk a minute longer
about me. Why, I’m just ashamed of myself!”
She arose quickly and crossed to the door with
short, firm steps. “Will you excuse me a minute?”
she asked.</p>

<p>When she had gone the four visitors looked at
each other silently. Finally, “Rotten shame, I
call it,” muttered Laurie. Ned nodded agreement.
Polly, whose gaze was fixed on Laurie expectantly,
said suddenly: “Laurie, if you have
anything in mind I think you’d ought to tell her.
It might make her feel more comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Anything in mind?” echoed Laurie. “I
haven’t. At least, only—”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort’s return with a dish of cake
stopped him.</p>

<p>A little later they were outside again, walking
silently away from the little white house with
the brown shutters. When they were at last out
of sight of the front windows Polly turned eagerly
toward Laurie.</p>

<p>“What were you going to say?” she demanded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
“You have thought of some plan, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Laurie hesitated, frowning thoughtfully. “Not
much of a one,” he answered. “I guess it
doesn’t amount to anything. Only—well, now
look here, doesn’t it seem that there ought to be
some place somewhere in this town that would
do for her? It wouldn’t have to be <em>much</em>, would
it? Maybe just a sort of shed that could be fixed
up and made comfortable? Or a nice stable that
has rooms above it. You know some stables have
quarters for the coachman or chauffeur or gardener.
Maybe—”</p>

<p>“Why, I think it’s a perfectly stunning idea!”
cried Polly. “No one thought of that!”</p>

<p>“But she’d have to pay rent just the same,
wouldn’t she?” asked Ned dubiously. “Some
rent, anyhow? And she said—”</p>

<p>“If we explained about her,” said Polly, “I’m
sure no one would think of asking rent for just
a stable attic—” Laurie’s chuckles interrupted.
“Well, whatever you call it. Loft, isn’t it? Anyhow,
perhaps just a—a nominal rent would be all
they’d ask.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we look right now and see if we
can’t find something?” asked Mae excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t we?” cried Polly eagerly.</p>

<p>“Just what I was about to propose,” said
Laurie a bit patronizingly, “when Ned butted in.
Let’s start in and do the old burg systematically.
Which way shall we go first?”</p>

<p>Dusk had settled over Orstead when the four,
footsore and weary, returned to the shop. Their
quest had been fruitless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>THE COACH MAKES A PROMISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Turner,” said Coach Mulford, taking the
vacant place on the bench beside Laurie
and laying a hand on his knees, “Turner, they
tell me you’re grooming a dark horse.”</p>

<p>“Sir?” Laurie looked blank. Pinky’s smile
told him that there was a joke somewhere about,
but the phrase was a new one to him and he didn’t
get the coach’s meaning. Mr. Mulford laughed.</p>

<p>“They tell me that you’re training a new
pitcher for us,” he explained. “How about it?”</p>

<p>Laurie reddened a bit. He wasn’t surprised
that the coach knew about it, for his crazy boast
and his daily work-outs with Kewpie were known
all over school and he was being joked unmercifully.
Those morning sessions now were being
attended by something of a gallery of interested
spectators who were generous with suggestions
and applause. But it occurred to him now that
Coach Mulford must think him rather a fool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“I—well, I’m sort of helping Kewpie Proudtree,”
he answered haltingly. “He wants to
learn to pitch, Mr. Mulford.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The coach evidently didn’t disapprove
of the proceeding. Laurie gathered that
from his tones. “I see. How’s he getting
on?”</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head. “Not very well,” he
said frankly.</p>

<p>“Sorry to hear that,” was the grave reply.
“Still, there’s quite a while yet, and I dare say
we’ll manage to get along with Beedle and the
others until your man’s ready.” Mr. Mulford
slapped Laurie’s knee again and again laughed.
Laurie laughed, too, but it wasn’t a whole-hearted
laugh. Aware of the coach’s amused
regard, he felt slightly resentful. After a moment
he said offhandedly:</p>

<p>“I reckon he’ll be ready for the Farview
game, sir.”</p>

<p>“Think so? Fine!” Mr. Mulford chuckled as
he arose. “Well, let me know when he is ready,
Turner.”</p>

<p>“If I do will you give him a trial?” asked
Laurie quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“What?” Mr. Mulford paused in his departure
and looked back. “Give him a trial? Why, I
don’t know, Turner,” he continued slowly, “but
I might.”</p>

<p>“You—you wouldn’t care to make that a
promise, would you, sir?” asked Laurie. Pinky’s
round, red face smiled back as, after a perceptible
pause, he nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll make it a promise, Turner,” he
agreed. “But, mind you, you mustn’t ask me to
waste my time. If your Great Unknown gets so
he can really pitch, you let me know, and I’ll
look him over. But no duds, Turner!”</p>

<p>When, just before supper that evening, Laurie
jubilantly repeated the conversation to Kewpie,
Kewpie was all swelled up over that title of Great
Unknown until Ned dryly remarked that most
Great Unknowns never amounted to a hill of
beans. Even that pessimistic utterance failed to
dispel all of Kewpie’s pleasure, however.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said. “But some of
them make good, don’t they? Well, here’s one
of ’em. You ask Nod if I didn’t pitch some
mighty nice curves this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” agreed Laurie glumly, “they curved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
all right, but you mustn’t think that a batter’s
going to step out of his box to hit your balls,
Kewpie. Batters aren’t that accommodating!”</p>

<p>“Gosh,” complained Kewpie, “you don’t give
a fellow credit when he deserves it. If you think
it’s any fun going through that stunt every
morning—”</p>

<p>“Who started it?” demanded Laurie.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right, but—”</p>

<p>“You’ll get a nice long rest pretty soon,” said
Ned soothingly. “Spring recess’ll be along in
less than two weeks, old son.”</p>

<p>Kewpie made no reply for a moment. Then,
“Well,” he began hesitantly, “I was thinking,
Nid, that maybe I ought—oughtn’t—oughtn’t
to go home at recess.”</p>

<p>“Not go home! For goodness’ sake, why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d lose a whole week, wouldn’t I?
You and Laurie will be here, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ned, with a notable lack of
enthusiasm. He and Laurie weren’t at all keen
on remaining at school during the spring vacation,
but it lasted only eight days, and as the journey to
California occupied four, why, as Laurie put it,
“they’d meet themselves coming back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Sure,” continued Kewpie. “Well, I ought to
stay, too, I guess, and get a lot of practice in.
Don’t you think so, Nod?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know.” Laurie looked startled.
The prospect of seven long days with nothing to
do but to catch Kewpie’s drops and curves seemed
decidedly lacking in attraction. There were moments
when Laurie’s determination wavered, and
this was one of them. “I suppose it would be a
mighty good idea, though,” he added listlessly.
Ned’s mouth trembled in a smile.</p>

<p>“Absolutely corking, Kewpie,” he declared.
“Of course, you ought to stay. But what about
your folks? Won’t they expect you home?”</p>

<p>Kewpie nodded. “But I wrote yesterday and
told them that maybe I wouldn’t be able to.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have seen that letter,” chuckled
Ned.</p>

<p>Kewpie grinned. “I just told them that I
might have to stay here on account of baseball
practice,” he explained innocently.</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Ned gravely. “Well,
you and Laurie can have a fine old time during
recess. No recitations to bother you or anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“O Death, where is thy sting?” murmured
Laurie.</p>

<p>“There is, though,” observed Ned, throwing
his legs over the side of the Morris chair and
eyeing Laurie quizzically, “just one complication
that occurs to me. I’ve heard talk of the baseball
team taking a Southern trip during recess.
In that case, Laurie, I suppose you’d go along.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” exclaimed Kewpie anxiously. “I
didn’t know that!”</p>

<p>“Nor any one else,” said Laurie, frowning.
“Don’t you know yet when Ned’s joshing?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” breathed Kewpie with immense relief.
“I thought maybe—”</p>

<p>“A swell chance I’d have of going with the
team if it did go,” said Laurie. “I can’t play
ball. I didn’t make a hit this afternoon.
Couldn’t even see the old pill! Guess I’ll quit
and go in for—for soccer or rowing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, rowing would be nice for you,” said Ned.
“You’re so big and strong! It’s a wonder to
me they haven’t grabbed you for the boat before
this!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet I could row as well as you, you old
bluffer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“There goes the bell!” yelped Kewpie.
“Gosh, I didn’t know it was so late! S’long!”
He collided with a chair and rushed out.</p>

<p>A week passed, a week of ideal weather. The
days were mildly warm and spring-like, and
Polly’s possible snow didn’t develop. It showered
occasionally, usually at night, and never
enough to interfere with baseball practice. Tennis
came into its own again, and Bob Starling
was torn between the desire to remain at home
and speed the making of the court behind the big
house and the longing to go over to the school
field and engage in combat with his ancient rivals.
The crews were on the river daily. The education
of Kewpie Proudtree as a baseball pitcher continued.
Laurie regained his batting eye in a measure
and talked no more of abandoning the diamond
for the courts or the four-oared shells.
Ned borrowed three golf-clubs from as many
different acquaintances, bought a fourth, and
accompanied Joe Stevenson, captain of last
autumn’s football’s eleven, around the links.
Mr. Goupil, of Sioux City, Iowa, continued to
emulate the Sphinx, and Miss Comfort was temporarily
installed in one of the up-stairs rooms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
at the Widow Deane’s, Polly sleeping in the room
below.</p>

<p>This arrangement had come about as the result
of an eleventh-hour hitch in the program that was
to have placed Miss Comfort in the poor-farm,
down the river about two miles. It turned out
that gaining admission to that institution was not
such a simple matter as one might suppose.
There was a great deal of red tape to be untied,
and the untying of it occupied the energies of
several of Orstead’s influential citizens. There
was no doubt that eventually Miss Comfort would
reach that haven, but meanwhile there ensued a
delay that might last a week—a fortnight—even
longer. Bob Starling’s father, instigated by his
sister, who, since the death of Bob’s mother, had
kept house for them, offered very generous assistance
of money. Other individuals had sought
to aid, as, too, had the congregation of the little
church that Miss Comfort attended. But all such
offers had been gratefully and firmly declined.
Hospitality the little old lady would have accepted,
but charity in the form of money was,
to her mind, something quite different and most
repugnant. So, until the last knot in the mass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
of red tape had been untied, she was to remain
as Mrs. Deane’s guest, an arrangement that
brought as much pleasure to the Widow and Polly
as it did to Miss Comfort.</p>

<p>Even Polly had now accepted the inevitable.
That first search for a modest habitation for the
exile had been discouragingly unsuccessful, as
had a second and more half-hearted one, and the
four sympathetic young folks had finally agreed
that the situation was beyond them. If Polly
was a wee bit disappointed in Laurie because of
his failure to find a solution of the problem—and
I think she was—she doubtless recognized the injustice
of that emotion and concealed it. Laurie,
once satisfied that everything had been done that
could be done, philosophically banished the matter
from his mind. Of course, he was just as sorry
as ever for Miss Comfort, but that didn’t keep
him from giving his full attention to matters of
more personal interest, such as trying to beat
Elk Thurston out for the position of first substitute
catcher, and striving, sometimes hopelessly,
to make Kewpie into a pitcher. It is always so
much easier to view another’s misfortunes with
philosophy than one’s own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Hillman’s played two games during the week
preceding the spring vacation and won one of
them. The second, with Lincolndale High School,
went to ten innings at 7 to 7 and was then called
to allow the visitors to catch a train. Laurie, to
his oddly mingled relief and disgust, saw action
in neither of the contests. Elk Thurston took the
place of Cas Bennett, the regular catcher, for the
last two innings in the first encounter, but in the
second game Cas worked through to the end.
Laurie had to acknowledge that Elk did pretty
well that Wednesday as a catcher—better, probably,
than he could have done. Laurie’s modesty,
though, did not keep him from telling himself
that, while he might have performed less skillfully
behind the plate than Elk had, he was
mighty sure he could have done better at the bat.
The Orstead High School pitcher, the third since
the beginning of the game, had nothing on the
ball, was, in fact, scarcely more of a twirler than
Kewpie Proudtree, and yet Elk had swung ingloriously
at the first three offerings and had
failed to so much as tickle one of them. “Bet
you,” thought Laurie, “I’d have <em>fouled</em> one,
anyhow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>The Lincolndale game was on Friday, and the
next day vacation began. By noon the school was
pretty well depopulated, although there remained
a scattering of unfortunate fellows who, like Ned
and Laurie, lived too far from Orstead to allow
of a home visit, or who could not afford the trip.
Kewpie had reached a compromise with his
parents. He was to go home and remain until
Tuesday morning. Then he was to return to
school and the demands of baseball. Ned was
cynical after Kewpie’s departure.</p>

<p>“Bet you we won’t see Kewpie again until a
week from to-morrow,” he said to Laurie.</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head. “I don’t know,” he
replied, “but I have a hunch that he will be back
Tuesday. Kewpie’s taking this pretty seriously,
Ned, and he’s really trying mighty hard. Sometimes
I think that if only he wasn’t so outrageously
like a dumpling he could do something at
it!”</p>

<small>ON LITTLE CROW</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Mae Ferrand was not on hand the next
afternoon when the twins and Bob Starling
reached the Widow Deane’s. Mae, Polly informed
them, had gone to Poughkeepsie to spend
Sunday with her grandmother. They decided to
go down to the river for their walk this afternoon,
and were soon descending Walnut Street. At the
station they crossed the tracks, passed the freight-shed,
and went southward beside the river, blue
and sparkling in the spring sunlight. Then they
had to return again to the tracks and cross a
bridge that spanned a narrow inlet. The inlet
connected the river with a shallow stretch of
marsh and water known as the Basin which lay
between the tracks and the big rock-quarry. The
quarry was slowly but very surely removing the
hill called Little Crow, and the face of the quarry
was fully eighty feet in height from the boulder-strewn
base to the tree-topped summit. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
here that stone was being obtained for the work
on which Mr. Starling’s company was engaged.
Spur-tracks ran from the railroad to the base of
the high cliff, about two hundred yards distant,
and from the railroad again to the stone-walled
dock wherein the quarry company loaded to
lighters for water transportation. The Basin
was a favorite place for skating in winter, and
Ned reminded the others of several episodes of
three months back.</p>

<p>“Remember the time Elk Thurston tried to get
ashore over there by the rushes?” asked Ned.
“Every time he put his foot down the ice broke
and let him through.”</p>

<p>“And he got angrier and angrier,” laughed
Polly, “and tried to hurry and—”</p>

<p>“Fell flat,” chuckled Laurie. “They told him
the ice wouldn’t hold him over there, but he always
knows a little more than any one else. And,
look, there’s the old <i>Pequot Queen</i> over there yet.
It’s a wonder some one doesn’t take her away
or break her up or something.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows who she belongs to, I heard,”
said Bob. “The old ferry company went bust
three or four years back, and the quarry company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
can’t touch her because she isn’t theirs. I heard
they had a bill for dockage as long as my arm
against the Queen, though.”</p>

<p>“Still, that’s the quarry dock she’s in,” said
Ned, “and she must be in the way there. I don’t
see why they don’t push her out and let her float
down the river.”</p>

<p>“She’d be a menace to navigation,” replied
Bob knowingly. “The law would get them if
they tried that.”</p>

<p>“Sort of like a fellow driving an automobile
into your front yard and leaving it there and
going off,” laughed Laurie. “You couldn’t put
it out into the street because that would be against
traffic rules and you couldn’t take possession
of it—”</p>

<p>“You could send it to a garage, though,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and pay the garage bills!”</p>

<p>“The quarry folks could see that it got on fire
accidently,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“It would only burn to the water-edge. The
hull would be just as much in the way as the
whole thing,” objected Bob.</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll let it stay just where it is,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
said Polly. “I’m sure it comes in very handy
when we come here skating. Remember that perfectly
ferocious day just after Christmas, Laurie,
when we were all nearly frozen and you made
a fire in the—the fireplace—”</p>

<p>“Fireplace!” echoed Ned. “That’s corking!”</p>

<p>“Well, the—the—why, I don’t see why it isn’t
a fireplace, Smarty. It’s the place you build the
fire, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Boiler,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, it just about saved my feet
from freezing right off,” declared Polly. “And
we had a lot of fun on the boat, and I hope no
one will do anything to it at all!”</p>

<p>“Guess you needn’t worry,” said Laurie.
“Looks as if she’d stay right here and rot to
pieces. Guess she’s got a good start already.”</p>

<p>Their homeward way led them through the
woods and around the slope of Little Crow Hill,
at first by an old wood-road and then by devious
trails through the now leafless forest. That was
the nearer way, but there was a longer, more
arduous, and far more attractive route that took
them to the summit of Little Crow and laid the
world at their feet; for from above the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
quarry they could look for miles and miles up and
down the broad river and across it and westward
to the rising foot-hills of the mountains. Since
to-day was as clear as a whistle and the air held
that crisp quality that makes exertion a pleasure,
Bob’s suggestion that they go up to the top of
the hill was accepted with enthusiasm by Ned and
Laurie. Polly, glancing solicitously at her dress,
hesitated. But she was, in the boys’ parlance,
“a good sport,” and she didn’t want to spoil
their fun. So after a brief moment she, too,
agreed, although with less enthusiasm, and they
turned northward from the wood-road and
ascended, for a time almost parallel to the railroad,
a narrow path where the branches clutched
mischievously at Polly’s skirt and proved that
she had had cause for indecision.</p>

<p>Laurie led, with Polly next. For a while the
going was not hard, but then outcropping boulders
set the path to twisting and winding, and soon
they were helping themselves upward by branches
and setting their feet carefully in the moist
tangles of root and moss. It was half-way up
a more than usually severe stretch, when every
muscle was tense, that Laurie suddenly stopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
short, turned about and exclaimed “<em>Say!</em>” in such
an unexpected and explosive burst of sound that
Polly, thrown from her balance by her attempt
to avoid collision with Laurie, and startled out
of her wits, fell back against Ned. Only Bob’s
prompt support from the rear saved the situation.
The three glared at the offender in outrage.</p>

<p>“Say,” exclaimed Ned, “what do you want to
do? Break all our necks? What’s the matter
with you, anyway, stopping like that and shouting
like a crazy man?”</p>

<p>Laurie stared back for an instant as though he
neither saw Ned nor heard him. Then his gaze
fell and he turned away. “Sorry,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“But—but what was it?” gasped Polly. “Did
you see a snake or—or something?”</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head and began to climb again.
“I just thought of something,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, for the love of lime-drops!” scolded his
brother. “Don’t think any more until we get to
the top, you poor prune!”</p>

<p>They went on, but it wasn’t difficult to perceive
that Laurie wasn’t obeying Ned’s injunction.
If he had been he wouldn’t have stumbled over
everything in his course and he wouldn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
missed the path above the big fern-clad rock near
the summit and gone wandering off into the brush
all by himself until called back by the others.
Ned observed him pityingly as he sheepishly rejoined
them.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to hold you when we get to the
top,” said Ned crushingly. “If we don’t you’ll
probably walk right over the edge! What in the
world’s got into you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Laurie, an absent expression
possessing his features again. “What
are you stopping here for?”</p>

<p>“Well, there <em>is</em> something,” said Ned accusingly,
“and I know what it is. You’ve got some
crazy idea in your bean.” He turned to Polly.
“He’s always like that when he thinks he’s
discovered something big, like perpetual motion
or—or how to make a million dollars. We’ll
have to watch him until he recovers, or he will do
himself harm. You go first, Bob, and I’ll keep
an eye on him.”</p>

<p>The rest of the climb was accomplished without
further incident, and they at last emerged in a
small cleared space at the top of the hill. I don’t
mean cleared in the sense of free from rubbish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
for occasional picnic-parties had offended against
nature as they have a way of doing, and the scanty
grass was littered with paper and empty cracker-boxes
and an occasional bottle or tin. Ned
viewed the scene disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Funny what human hogs some folks are,” he
growled, kicking an empty olive-bottle over the
edge of the cliff. He paused until, after an appreciable
interval, the distant tinkling sound of
breaking glass met his ears. “It’s enough to
make you sick. Folks who can’t stand a speck
of dust on their automobile will get out and eat
their lunch and leave the place looking like a
pigsty. Ought to be brought back and made to
eat every scrap of the mess they leave behind
them.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” agreed Bob, “but I don’t believe
these folks were automobilists, Ned. It’s a long
way up here from the road.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter,” said Ned, “whether they
came in a car or walked; they’re hogs just the
same.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s sit down and get our breaths,”
said Polly, suiting action to words. “That’s a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
perfectly frightful climb, isn’t it. I don’t think
I tore my dress, though.” She was making inspection
and looked vastly relieved as no damage
showed.</p>

<p>“Better luck going down,” said Bob cheerfully,
and Polly made a face at him as he sprawled
beside Ned. Laurie had not joined them on the
grass, but instead was lounging toward the edge
of the cliff, his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Laurie, please don’t go so close,” called Polly
from a dozen feet away. “It makes me feel sort
of squirmy.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Laurie didn’t hear her. He was very
near the edge now, close by a pine that leaned
outward at an angle, its roots clinging to the thin
crust of earth that hid the rock beneath. Ned
glanced toward him, and an expression of disapproval
came to his face.</p>

<p>“He thinks he’s smart,” he said contemptuously.
“He’s always liked to walk on roofs
and act silly goat that way.” He raised his
voice. “<em>Laurie!</em>”</p>

<p>Laurie gave a start. “Yes?” he answered.
Then—well, then everything happened all at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
and with incredible speed. They saw Laurie
grasp suddenly at the leaning tree, saw him miss
it, saw one foot disappear over the edge in a tiny
cloud of brown dust, and then, in almost the same
instant, Laurie just wasn’t there!</p>

<small>ON THE QUARRY SHELF</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was an instant of incredulous horror
on the cliff top. Then Polly’s smothered
gasp broke the silence, and the two boys were on
their feet. Short of the edge, Ned faltered for a
moment, sick and trembling, and it was Bob who
crouched on hands and knees and looked first
down the steeply sloping face of rock. Beside
him the earth was still trickling where Laurie’s
unwary foot had broken off an overhanging
crust.</p>

<p>For a second Bob’s gaze, fearfully searching
the rocky débris far below, saw nothing. Then
came a sharp cry of relief from Ned, who had
now dropped beside him, and at the same moment
Bob’s gaze, retraveling the face of rock, fell on
Laurie.</p>

<p>About thirty feet below them he was, his feet
set on a shelf scarcely four inches wide, his right
hand stretched high and its fingers hooked over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
a still narrower ledge, his left hand flung outward,
its palm pressed against the smooth surface. His
head leaned against the raised shoulder, his forehead
close to the rock. Viewed from below the
quarry face looked perpendicular, as, indeed, it
was farther around where the height was less,
but here there was a perceptible slope, slight but
sufficient to have saved Laurie from a headlong
plunge to the strewn fragments at the base. His
cap was gone and the miniature landslide had
powdered his head and shoulders with red dust.</p>

<p>“Laurie!” called Ned tremulously.</p>

<p>For a space there was no answer. Then
Laurie’s voice reached them, weak and muffled.
“Yeah?”</p>

<p>He didn’t raise his face.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked Bob anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, not—yet.” He stopped and then added,
“Scraped a bit.”</p>

<p>“Can you hold on until we—we—” Ned
stopped because he couldn’t think just then what
it was they could do.</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” answered Laurie. “Is
there ... anything near my left hand ... I
can reach, Ned?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“No. Wait. Yes, there’s a sort of edge about
six inches higher. Can you reach it? Further
up. Nearer you now. That’s it!” Laurie’s
questing fingers had found the spot. It wasn’t
much of a hold, only a bit of rough rock projecting
an inch or so from the smooth face. Ned was
suddenly aware that Polly was crouched beside
him, crying nervously. He tried hard to think
clearly. After a moment he said: “Laurie,
we’re going for a rope. It will take some time,
but—but it’s the only thing I can think of. Can
you hold on until we get back?”</p>

<p>“I’ll stick,” was the grim answer. His voice
was clearer now and steadier. “How far down
am I?”</p>

<p>“About thirty feet.” Ned stumbled to his feet.
“No use both of us going, Bob,” he said hurriedly.
“You stay. And Polly. I guess I can find rope
at the quarry.” He was off then, running down
the path. Bob dropped to his knees again beside
Polly. Polly was speaking, trying to make
her voice steady and confident.</p>

<p>“It won’t be long, Laurie,” she called. “Be—be
brave and—”</p>

<p>“Hello, Polly,” answered Laurie from below,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
a faint reminder of his old insouciance in his
voice. “Nice fix, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but don’t worry, and—you’d better not
talk.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’d rather,” answered Laurie. “Sort
of keeps me from thinking about—things.”
After a moment he continued. “Position’s sort
of cramped, Polly. Bob there, or did he go, too?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m here,” answered Bob. “I’ve been
thinking—”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it,” said Laurie. “I tried it, and
now look at me! Wish my legs wouldn’t tremble.
How wide’s the thing I’m standing on, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Three inches. Maybe four. What I was—”</p>

<p>“Rock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a sort of narrow ledge across the face;
a fault, as they call it. It runs downward at your
left almost to the bottom, I’d say. Listen, Nod.
Suppose I got a long pole and lowered one end
to you and held the other. Would that be easier
for you to hold on to?”</p>

<p>Laurie considered a moment. “I reckon so,”
he answered. “My right arm’s just about dislocated.
Try it, will you, Bob?”</p>

<p>Bob arose and disappeared into the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“Wish I could stand on my heels for a while,”
said Laurie. “My toes are trying to dance.
Where’s Ned gone for the rope?”</p>

<p>“To the quarry, he said,” Polly replied. “If
Bob and I made a sort of rope of our clothes,
Laurie, wouldn’t it be better than a pole?”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe so. I wouldn’t feel awfully
easy in my mind if I trusted to that sort of rope.
Anyway, I don’t intend to have you make rags
of your new dress!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Laurie, as if a new dress mattered!”
exclaimed Polly. “I do wish it wasn’t so thin,
though. Here comes Bob.”</p>

<p>Bob brought the dead trunk of a young black
birch about five inches thick at the butt where,
by hacking with his knife and twisting, he had
managed to sever it. Now he slashed the larger
branches away. “Good thing it’s dried out,” he
said to Polly. “If it wasn’t it would be too
heavy to hold. Hope it’s long enough!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob, I don’t believe it is,” said Polly
anxiously.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t I can find one that is.”</p>

<p>But it was. When Bob had lowered the smaller
end down the cliff at Laurie’s right and Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
had very carefully and rather fearfully unclasped
his numb fingers from their rocky hold
and clutched them about the tree there remained
a few inches of the butt end above the level of
the ground. Taking a firm hold with both hands
at arm’s length as he lay facedown, Bob smiled
his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“She’ll hold you, Nod, even if the shelf you’re
standing on gives way! Polly can sit on my legs
if she has to, and after that I’m good for all
day.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s a lot better,” said Laurie.
“Wow, that arm was almost out at the socket!
Can you see this fault, as you call it from where
you are?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Look it over, will you? Does it go right to
the bottom?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not quite, I guess. I can’t just see the
end of it. There’s a three-cornered hunk of
ledge sticking out down there. I guess it stops
about a dozen feet from the bottom, Nod.”</p>

<p>“All right. Tell you what I’m figuring on.
You check me up, you two. Suppose I have that
rope that Ned’s gone for. It wouldn’t be any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
good for me to try and climb it, for I’m aching all
over and I just wouldn’t have the strength. If I
tied it around me you three couldn’t pull me up
over that edge. Of course if the rope’s long
enough you fellows can lower me down, or I could
put a turn of the rope around me and get down
myself, I reckon. How about that?”</p>

<p>“You’d get awfully scraped up, I’m afraid,”
said Bob. “I’m pretty sure the three of us can
pull you up, Nod.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you could. It would be risky,
anyway. Maybe, though, I can climb up somehow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” offered Polly, “Ned will bring
some one back with him to help.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so,” said Laurie. “If he doesn’t,
the next best thing is a rope long enough to reach
to the bottom. My idea was this, Bob.” He
paused long enough to shift one foot gingerly and
relieve his jumping nerves. “I thought I could
tie the end of the rope under my shoulders and
work along this ledge that I’m standing on until
I got where I could jump or drop or something.”</p>

<p>“We could lower you the rest of the way if the
rope lasted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Question is—” Laurie’s
words were coming slower now, with pauses between—“question
is, can you folks follow along
the edge and hold your end of the rope?”</p>

<p>Bob turned his head and studied. After a
minute he said: “Yes, I’m sure we can. The
trees are close to the edge in places, but we could
manage to pass the rope around them. We’ll
see to that. Trouble is, Nod, there’s a place
about ten or twelve yards from where you are
where the blamed shelf sort of peters out for a
ways, nearly five feet, I’d say.”</p>

<p>“That so?” Laurie deliberated. “Well, if you
fellows took a turn around a tree with your end
of the rope I reckon I could make it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you could,” Bob agreed. “Sure,
you could!”</p>

<p>“All right. Guess that’s ... the best plan,”
said Laurie tiredly. “How long’s Ned ...
been gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he <em>must</em> be back in a minute!” cried Polly.
“He’s been gone a long, long time.”</p>

<p>“Seen him down there ... yet?”</p>

<p>“He probably went to the office-building near
the dock,” answered Bob. “You can’t see that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
from here. Keep the old dander up, Nod.”</p>

<p>“I know,” agreed Laurie, “only ... I ain’t
so well in my dander! Ought to see ... a
doctor—”</p>

<p>“He’s coming!” cried Polly. “I hear him!”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke joyfully, Ned came into
sight, panting, perspiring, flushed, a coil of rope
over a shoulder. He fairly staggered up the last
of the ascent and across the small clearing, his
eyes questioning Polly’s anxiously.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” cried Polly. Ned exhaled a
deep breath of relief and struggled to disencumber
himself of the rope. The girl sprang to his
aid.</p>

<p>“I broke a window in the shed down there,”
panted Ned. “This was all I could find, but it’s
good and strong.” He began with trembling fingers
to fashion a noose.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned,” faltered Polly, “it’s so short!”</p>

<p>“How long?” called Bob.</p>

<p>“Forty feet,” replied Ned. “Maybe more.
It’s more than long enough!”</p>

<p>Polly explained hurriedly, and Ned’s face fell
as he stared despairingly at the cliff’s edge.
Then his shoulders went back. “We’ll get him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
up,” he said grimly. “We’ll get him up or I’ll
go down with him!” He went on bunglingly
with the noose. Bob and Laurie were talking
beyond the edge.</p>

<p>“Rope’s too short for your scheme,” Bob said
as cheerfully as he could. “Only about forty
or fifty feet, Nod.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t do, eh?” Laurie asked after a moment’s
silence.</p>

<p>“No, too short by thirty feet, I guess. Twenty,
anyway. We’ll have to pull you up, old chap.
We’ll manage it.”</p>

<p>Ned was peering down now. “I’ve made a
slip-noose, Laurie. We’ll lower it down, and
you can get one arm through and then the other.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said Bob. “You’d better take
hold of that ledge again with your right hand first,
Nod. These branches will be in the way. Can
you reach it? Higher yet. There you are! All
right.” Bob pulled up the birch-tree, edged his
body back, rolled over, and took several deep
breaths. Then he rubbed his neck vigorously and
got to his knees. “Polly,” he directed, “you
take hold of the end of the rope and, for the love
of Mike, don’t let go of it! Lower away now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Nid. Coming down, old chap. Left arm first.
Straighten it up. All right. Get your hold
again. Now the other. Hold the rope closer in,
Nid. Right-o! Fine! Tighten up easy, Nid.
How’s that, down there?”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks. Ned, don’t start anything
until you’ve rested a bit. I can hear you puffing
down here. I’m fine now and can spend the day
here.”</p>

<p>Ned sank down and relaxed, breathing heavily
and mopping his face. “Best way to do,” said
Bob to him, “will be to take a turn of rope around
a tree and let Polly take up the slack as we haul.
It’ll be a hard tug, with the rope binding over
the edge, but I guess we can do it.” Ned nodded,
took a deep breath, and stood up.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” he said shortly.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>THE <i>PEQUOT QUEEN</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The first pull on the rope resulted only in
sawing through the turf and earth at the
edge of the cliff until the rock was reached. The
next tug brought a few inches more at the cost
of terrific effort, for the rope must pass at almost
right angles over the raw edge of the rock.
Laurie, his hands clasping the rope above his
head to lessen the strain across his chest, was
showered with earth. Another heave, and Ned
and Bob went back a scant foot, Polly, her weight
on the rope, tightening the slack around the tree.
Once more the two boys dug their heels into the
ground and strained. This time there was no
result. They tried again. It was as though they
were pulling at the cliff itself. The rope tautened
under their efforts but yielded not an inch.</p>

<p>“Must be ... caught!” gasped Bob.</p>

<p>Ned, weak from that hurried climb up the hill,
nodded, and closed his eyes dizzily. The moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
silence was broken by a hail from Laurie.</p>

<p>“No good, you fellows! The rope’s worked
into a crevice of the rock and is jammed there.
I’ll have to climb it myself. Make your end fast
around something and stand by to give me a
hand—if I make it!”</p>

<p>Bob silently questioned Ned, and the latter
nodded again. “Let him try,” he said huskily.
“If he can’t—”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait, wait!” cried Polly. “We’re—we’re
perfect idiots! He doesn’t have to do that,
Ned! He can walk along that ledge, and we can
hold the rope—”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t long enough,” Bob expostulated.</p>

<p>“Not down,” said Polly impatiently; “up!”</p>

<p>“Up? By Jove, that’s so! See what she
means, Ned? Here, let’s get this tied to the
tree!” A moment later Bob was at the edge,
his eager gaze following the narrow ledge as
it ascended at Laurie’s right. Scarcely twenty
feet beyond, it ended at a perpendicular fissure
hardly four feet below the top. Gleefully he
made known the discovery to Laurie, and the
latter, stretched like a trussed fowl against the
rock, his toes still just touching the shelf, grunted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Never thought of that,” he said disgustedly.
He stretched his head back until he could see the
shelf. Then, “It’s a cinch,” he affirmed.
“You’ll have to get the rope free first, though,
and ease up on it until I can get my feet back
on the ledge. Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“Have to,” answered the other cheerfully.
Cautiously he and Ned untied the rope from
about the tree, gave it some three inches of slack,
retied it, and set to work at the edge of the cliff.
Or, rather, Bob worked, for Ned’s hands trembled
so that he couldn’t. The rope was fast in a
jagged-edged notch of the rock, and Bob’s only
implement, his pocket-knife, was somewhat inadequate.
But he made it do. Using the handle
like a tiny hammer, he chipped and chipped until
finally the rope began to slip downward and
Laurie’s weight rested again on the ledge. The
end about the tree was unfastened; the rope was
lifted from the channel it had dug through the
overlying soil and carried a yard to the left.
Then, with Ned and Bob and Polly holding it,
their heels dug firmly into the sod, Laurie began
his journey.</p>

<p>It was slow work at first, for his nerves and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
muscles responded ill to the demands of his brain,
and delays came when those above cautiously
moved their position, taking new holds on the
slowly shortening rope. Had Laurie been fresh
for the task he would have swarmed up there
in no time at all. As it was, it took a good ten
minutes to reach the end of his journey; and,
even so, he did not proceed to the limit of his
narrow foot-path but, once his hands could reach
the edge, squirmed his way over, Bob and Ned
pulling and tugging.</p>

<p>Once there, he flopped over on his back in the
tangle of brush and stretched legs and arms relievedly.
In the little silence that ensued Bob
removed the rope from Laurie and coiled it with
unnecessary exactitude. Then Laurie took a
long, deep breath, sat up, and said “Thanks!”</p>

<p>That relaxed the general tension. Bob laughed
queerly, Ned grinned in a twisted way, and Polly
dabbed at her eyes with a diminutive handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Welcome,” said Bob dryly. Then all four
began to laugh and talk at the same time. After
a moment of that Bob laid a hand on Laurie’s
collar. “Let’s get out of this,” he said. Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
got to his feet somewhat shakily, and they fought
their way back to the little clearing. “Now,”
said Bob, “we’ll just sit down and look at that
view we came up here to see and get rested for
a quarter of an hour. I don’t know how Laurie
feels, but I’m all in!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you are,” responded Laurie. “Guess
I had the easiest part of it.”</p>

<p>“You look it,” answered Bob sarcastically.
Laurie’s face was brown with dirt, his knuckles
were bleeding, there was a cut on his chin, and
his clothes were torn until they looked fit only
for the ragman. Ned, who had been scowling
blackly for the last minute or two, broke into
sudden speech.</p>

<p>“Of all the crazy lunatics, Laurie,” he began
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>please</em>, Ned!” cried Polly. “He didn’t
mean to do it!”</p>

<p>“Let him say it,” said Laurie humbly. “I
deserve it, and it’ll do him good.”</p>

<p>But Ned’s eloquence had fled him. He said
“<em>Humph!</em>” and turned his head away and stared
hard at the wide expanse of scenery spread before
him. The others pretended not to know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
there were tears in his eyes, and Bob said hastily:
“Well, all’s swell that ends swell! How did it
happen, anyway, Nod?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was—was thinking about something and
didn’t realize I was so close to the edge, I guess.
Then Ned called to me and I turned around quick
and one foot began to go. I tried to catch hold
of that tree there and missed it. Next thing I
knew I was sliding down the rock. I guess that
trying to catch hold of the tree saved me, because
it threw me forward and, instead of falling outward,
I went sliding down with my face scraping
against the rock. Somehow, just by luck, I got
hold of a root for a second. It broke off, but it
helped, I guess, for I stopped with my feet on
that ledge and my right hand holding on to something
above me. I suppose I made sort of a fuss
about it down there,” he concluded apologetically,
“but you don’t know how quivery your nerves
get, Bob. Seemed like my legs wanted to dance
all the time!”</p>

<p>“Son, you certainly had a narrow squeak of it,”
said Bob solemnly. “Gee, when I saw you go
over—”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was perfectly horrible,” shuddered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Polly. “And then afterward, while Ned was
gone—”</p>

<p>“There’s a busted window down there that
some one’s got to settle for,” growled Ned.</p>

<p>“Believe me, old scout,” replied Laurie feelingly,
“I’m willing to settle for a hundred busted
windows! Of course, I don’t mean that it
wouldn’t have been a heap more considerate of
you to have slipped the catch with your knife and
saved me the expense.”</p>

<p>Ned faced them again then, glaring at his
brother. “You poor fish!” he said contemptuously.</p>

<p>“That’s me,” agreed Laurie smilingly.
“Pulled up with a line!”</p>

<p>Polly and Bob laughed, the former a trifle hysterically.
Then Ned’s mouth twitched itself into
a grin. “Laurie, you’re an awful fool,” he said
affectionately.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right, Neddie.” He climbed
to his feet, stamped them experimentally, seemed
to approve of the result, and added, “Well, unless
some one else is going to fall over, say we go
home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“I’m ready,” agreed Bob. “How about the
rope? Oughtn’t we—”</p>

<p>“In payment for my share in the recent—er—episode,”
said Laurie, “I’ll look after it.
Where’d you get it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we all go?” asked Polly. “It
isn’t <em>much</em> farther that way.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” agreed Bob. “Besides, who knows
what Laurie would do next if we let him go
alone?”</p>

<p>So they set off down the hill again, every one
by now extremely merry and light-hearted in the
reaction. They dropped the rope through the
window in the shed adjoining the office of the
quarry company and retraced their steps to the
village and up Walnut Street and so, finally, just
as dusk began to settle down, reached the little
shop. There it was Polly who voiced the thought
that had been in the minds of the rest for some
time.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Polly, “it would be better if
we didn’t say anything about what happened.”</p>

<p>“Polly,” declared Laurie relievedly—and
slangily, “you spoke a mouthful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ned. “No use worrying folks
about a thing when it’s all over.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” chimed in Bob. “Guess it
won’t happen again, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Not with me in the rôle of happenee,” said
Laurie with conviction.</p>

<p>“If it ever does,” said Ned, “you’ll hang over
the cliff until you dry up and blow away for all
of me, you poor simp!”</p>

<p>But when they had said good night to Bob
Ned’s tune was different. “Old-timer,” he said
after a silence, “you sure had me scared.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Laurie soberly. “Sorry, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. ’S all right.” Ned slipped his arm
in Laurie’s. “Wish you’d cut out that sort of
thing, though. Always gives me heart-failure.
It’s risky business, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Right,” agreed Laurie. After a minute, as
they passed through the gate, he added, “No
more I’ll risk my neck on dizzy height.”</p>

<p>“Well said, for if you do you’ve me to fight!”</p>

<p>That evening the twins were content to lounge
in easy-chairs in the recreation-room and read,
refusing challenges to ping-pong, chess, and various
other engagements requiring exertion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
mind or body. They went early to bed and, although
Laurie roused once to hear Ned in the
throes of nightmare and had to quiet him before
returning to his own dreamless slumber, awoke
in the morning their normal selves again.</p>

<p>After breakfast that morning Laurie announced
to Ned that he was going to walk down and explain
the broken window, and settle for it if
settlement was demanded. Ned said, “All right,
come along.” But Laurie persuaded the other
that his presence during the conference with the
quarry company officials was not only unnecessary
but inadvisable. “You see,” he elaborated,
“it’s going to require tact, old son, and Tact,
as you know, is my middle name. Now, if I took
you along you’d be sure to say something to
queer the whole show and I’d have to fork over
a dollar, maybe. No, better leave this to me,
Ned.”</p>

<p>“Must say you fancy yourself a bit this morning,”
scoffed Ned. “All right, though. Come
over to Bob’s when you get back. I told him I’d
go around there and look at the court.”</p>

<p>Laurie saved his dollar by narrating a moving
tale of his fall from the cliff to the occupants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
of the small office down by the river. One weazened
little man who held a pen in his mouth and
talked through it or around it—Laurie couldn’t
decide which—reminded the visitor that if he had
not trespassed on quarry company property he
wouldn’t have got in trouble. But it was plain
that this view was not popular with the other
members of the force present, and Laurie was
permitted to depart with his last week’s allowance
intact.</p>

<p>From the office he made his way across toward
the stone-walled dock where lay the <i>Pequot Queen</i>.
Once he paused, turned, and sent his gaze to the
great mass of rock that arose precipitately from
beyond the littered floor of the quarry. He
couldn’t see the tiny ledge that had saved his
life yesterday, but there, looking very small from
down here, was the leaning tree, and he measured
the distance to the rock-strewn ground beneath
and shuddered. He was still gazing when
there was a dull concussion and a cloud of gray
dust, and a great pile of rock slid down the face.
The little locomotive tooted and came rocking
toward the railway, dragging a flat-car loaded
with two great squares of rock. On the farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
side of the small dock a lighter was being loaded,
a big boom swinging from cars to deck to the
music of a puffing engine and the shrill piping
of a whistle. Laurie continued his way to the
<i>Pequot Queen</i>.</p>

<p>A few years before the boat had been used in
the ferry service between Orstead and Hamlin,
across the river. Then the business failed to
show a profit, the company was dissolved, and
the <i>Pequot Queen</i> was pushed into the quarry
company’s dock—without permission, if rumor
was to be credited—and left to rot. She was
about fifty feet long and very broad of beam.
The stern was occupied by a cabin with many
windows, a few of which were still unbroken.
Amidships, if one may apply the term to a launch,
was a small engine-room in which a rusted upright
engine still stood amid a litter of coal-dust.
A door led to a smaller compartment, the wheel-house.
Between that and the bow was a space
for luggage and freight. The <i>Pequot Queen</i> had
not carried vehicles.</p>

<p>At one time the boat had doubtless shone resplendent
in white paint and gold-leaf. Now
there were few traces of either remaining. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
name was still legible on each side of the bow,
however, in faded black. Through the roof a
rusty smoke-stack pushed its way to lean perilously
to starboard. Atop the cabin, reached by
a narrow companion, benches inside a pipe-railing
had afforded accommodation for passengers
in fine weather. The boat was secured fore and
aft with frayed hawsers, and her rail lay close
to the wall. Laurie viewed her speculatively
from stem to stern and then stepped aboard.
Had there been any one about to observe him
they might have thought that here was a possible
purchaser, for he went over the boat completely
and exhaustively, giving, however, most of his
time to the cabin. In the end he went ashore and
once more viewed the derelict in frowning speculation.
There was no doubt that the <i>Pequot
Queen</i> had outlived her use as a water-craft. She
still floated and would probably continue to float
for many years yet, but old age had claimed her,
as rotting timbers and yawning seams showed.
Yet Laurie, whether or not he was a prospective
purchaser, turned away at last with an expression
of thoughtful satisfaction on his countenance.</p>

<p>Back by the railroad, he stopped and viewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
his surroundings intently. On one side lay the
bridge, with the Basin beyond and to the left,
and the big quarry to his right. On the other
side was the company office and shed, the dock
and pier, the latter piled high with roughly-squared
blocks of stone. Toward town the
river’s margin was unoccupied for a space, and
then came the coal-wharves and the lumber company’s
frontage. It was a noisy and dust-laden
spot in which the <i>Pequot Queen</i> had been left to
pass her declining years, and Laurie shook his
head slowly as though the realization of the fact
displeased him. Finally he crossed the bridge
again, hurrying a little in order not to compete
for passage with a slow-moving freight from the
north, and continued along the river-front until
he had passed the station and the warehouses
across the track and was again allowed a view
of the stream unimpeded by buildings. Here
there was no wall along the river, but now and
then the remains of an ancient wooden bulkhead
still stood between the dusty road and the lapping
water. Here and there, too, a rotted hulk lay
careened or showed naked ribs above the surface
further out. Across the road hardly more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
a lane now, a few dejected but respectable dwellings
stood behind their tiny front yards. Behind
them the hill sloped upward less abruptly than
farther back and was thickly clustered with unpretentious
houses wherein the industrious foreign-born
citizens of Orstead lived. Compared
to the vicinity of the quarry, however, this section
of town was clean and quiet. There were trees
here, and later on there would be grass along the
unfrequented road and flowers in the little gardens.
Westward lay the sunlit river and the
wooded shore beyond. Laurie nodded approvingly
more than once as he dawdled along, paying,
as it appeared, special attention to the margin
of the stream. Finally, more than an hour
after he had left school, he retraced his steps as
far as Ash Street and turned uphill.</p>

<p>Ash Street was two blocks north of Walnut
and, having an easier grade to climb, was less
devious in its journey. It brought Laurie at
length to Summit Street a short block from the
little white house from which Miss Comfort had
lately removed. As he passed it Laurie observed
that so far no vandal hand had been laid on it.
The brown shutters were closed at the down-stairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
windows, and the buds on the lilac-bushes
were swelling fast. Somehow these two facts,
apparently unrelated, combined to bring a little
pang of sadness to the observer. He went on,
with only a glance down Pine Street to the blue
shop, and entered the side gate of the Coventry
place.</p>

<small>A PERFECTLY GORGEOUS IDEA</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ned and Bob were watching Thomas, the
man-of-all-work, rolling the cinder surface
of the new tennis-court. Theirs was a pleasant
occupation for such a morning, and Laurie joined
them where they sat on a pile of posts and boards
that had once been a grape-arbor and that had
been removed to make way for the court.</p>

<p>“What happened to you?” asked Ned.
“Thought maybe they’d had you arrested. Bob
and I were just talking of pooling our resources
and bailing you out.”</p>

<p>“I found I had nearly ninety cents,” said Bob
proudly.</p>

<p>“No, they were all right about it,” replied
Laurie musingly. Then he lapsed into silence,
staring thoughtfully at Thomas as he paced to
and fro behind the stone roller.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” asked Bob, nodding
at the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Corking. Pretty nearly done, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly. It’ll take about two days to
put the gravel on. They’re going to bring the
first load this afternoon. It has to have clay
mixed with it, you know, and that makes it slower.
And then it’s got to be rolled well—”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Laurie, “a turf court
would have been easier.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they don’t last. You know that.
And it’s the very dickens to get a grass surface
level.”</p>

<p>Laurie nodded. It was evident to Ned, who
had been watching him closely, that Laurie’s mind
was not on the tennis-court. “What’s eating
you, partner?” he asked finally. Laurie started.</p>

<p>“Me? Nothing. That is, I’ve been thinking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” begged Ned. “You know what it did
to you yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I want you and Bob to be at Polly’s this afternoon
when she gets home from school. I’ve got
something to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Tell us now,” suggested Bob. Laurie shook
his head.</p>

<p>“No use saying it twice.”</p>

<p>“What’s it about?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“About—about Miss Comfort.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Bob, “I thought that was done
with. What about her, Nod?” But Laurie
shook his head, and their pleas for enlightenment
were vain.</p>

<p>“You’ll know all about it this afternoon,” he
said. “So shut up.” A minute after he asked,
“Say, Bob, does your father know the folks who
run that quarry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. He buys stone from them.
Why?”</p>

<p>“I want to meet the head guy, president or
general manager or whatever he calls himself.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Want to meet him! What for? Going to get
after him for not having a railing around the top
of the bluff?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Know any one here who has a
launch?”</p>

<p>“Lunch? Say, what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say lunch, you goop; I said launch,
l-a-u—”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>launch</em>! Why, no, I don’t believe so. I
know a fellow who owns a canoe—”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Laurie with deep sarcasm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
“and I know a fellow who owns a bean-shooter,
but it doesn’t interest me. There must be some
one who has a launch around here. There are
half a dozen on the river.”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s a man down there who rents
boats, you idiot. I think he has some sort of a
launch. I thought you meant—”</p>

<p>“What’s his name? Where’s he live?”</p>

<p>“Name’s Wilkins or Watkins or something,
and he lives—I don’t know where he lives, but he
keeps his boats up by the old chain-works.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. You fellows going to spend the
day here? Let’s do something.”</p>

<p>“Want some tennis?” asked Bob eagerly.
“I’ll take on you and Nid.”</p>

<p>Laurie looked inquiringly at his brother.
“Would you?” he asked. “Seems sort of too bad
to take advantage of his ignorance.”</p>

<p>“It’ll teach him a lesson,” answered Ned,
rising, stretching, and looking commiseratingly
down at the challenger. “Pride goeth before a
fall and a haughty spirit—”</p>

<p>“Before the Turners,” completed Laurie.
“Come on to the slaughter, Bob, before my heart
softens and I let you off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>Shortly after three that afternoon, Laurie,
perched on a counter in the Widow Deane’s shop,
had the floor. That sounds peculiar, I acknowledge,
but you know what I mean. They were in
the shop because Mrs. Deane and Miss Comfort
were occupying the back—pardon me, the garden.
“It’s like this,” Laurie was telling Polly, Mae,
Ned, and Bob. “We couldn’t find a place on
land for Miss Comfort, and so it occurred to me
that a place on the water might do.” He paused
to enjoy the effect of this strange announcement.</p>

<p>“On the water!” echoed Polly. “Why, whatever
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Mae, “whatever—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you get it?” asked Ned. “He wants
Miss Comfort to join the navy!”</p>

<p>Laurie grinned. “Shut up, you idiot! You
know the <i>Pequot Queen</i>?” They all agreed
silently that they did. “Well, I’ve been all over
the boat this morning. It would take about two
or three days—and a few dollars, of course—to
make her into just as nice a house as any one
would want. Take that cabin—”</p>

<p>“But, look here, you three-ply goop,” interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Ned, “Miss Comfort wouldn’t want to
live on a tumble-down old ferry-boat!”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Laurie. “Have
you asked her?”</p>

<p>“But—but she’d be afraid, Laurie,” protested
Polly. “I’m sure I should! Suppose it floated
away or—or sank—”</p>

<p>“Suppose it spread its wings and flew on top
of the court-house,” answered Laurie sarcastically.
“It couldn’t float away because it would
be moored to the bank, and it couldn’t sink because
there wouldn’t be enough water under it.
Now, just listen a minute until I get through. Of
course I know that the scheme sounds funny to
you folks because you haven’t any imagination.
As for saying that Miss Comfort wouldn’t live in
the <i>Pequot Queen</i>, you don’t <em>know</em> anything of the
sort. I’m blamed certain that if I was—were
Miss Comfort I’d a lot rather live in a nice clean
boat tied to the bank than go to the poor-farm!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly dubiously, “you’re a man.”</p>

<p>“A man!” jeered Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, you know perfectly well what I mean,”
said Polly. It was evident that Polly wanted
very much to be convinced of the practicability of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the plan, and her objection had been almost apologetic.
Mae, taking her cue from her friend,
awaited further enlightenment in pretty perplexity.</p>

<p>“Miss Comfort has enough to furnish it with,”
continued Laurie. “At least, Polly said she had
taken a lot of stuff with her.” Polly nodded
vigorously. “All we’d have to do would be to
board up about four windows on each side of the
cabin, put some shades or curtains at the others,
put a new lock on the door, run a stove-pipe
through the roof—”</p>

<p>“Perfectly simple and easy,” said Ned. “Go
on, son.”</p>

<p>“That’s about all. That cabin’s big enough
for her to live in comfortably, big enough for a
stove and bed and table and chairs—and—and
everything. Then, there’s the roof, too. Why,
she could have a roof-garden up there, and a
place to dry her clothes—”</p>

<p>“After she’s fallen overboard?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Laurie a trifle
warmly. “Have your fun, but the scheme’s all
right, and if you’d quit spoofing and stop to
think seriously a minute—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I think it’s a perfectly splendid idea!”
asserted Polly with a bewildering change of
front.</p>

<p>“Gorgeous!” chimed in Mae.</p>

<p>“If only Miss Comfort can be persuaded to try
a life on the ocean wave,” added Ned dryly.
“Seems to me the first thing to do is to ask her
what <em>she</em> thinks of it.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Laurie. “The first thing
is for you to go down there with me right now
and see for yourselves. If you don’t agree with
me we’ll just let it drop.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Polly. “Come on, every
one! Oh, I do hope that Miss Comfort will like
it!”</p>

<p>“How about the owners?” asked Bob as, a
minute later, they were all on the way to the
river. “Well, not the owners, for I suppose
there aren’t any. But what about the quarry
people, Nod? Think they’ll let us have it?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp186">
  <img src="images/i_fp186.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_185">They all accompanied Laurie to the <i>Pequot Queen</i></a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Don’t see why not. It’s no good to them,
and it’s in their way. That’s where your father
comes in, Bob. I want him to introduce us to the
head guy and say a good word. Think he’d
mind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“No, but even if Miss Comfort lived in the boat,
Nod, it would be just as much in the way,
wouldn’t it?” Bob looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“No, because it wouldn’t be there any longer.
We’d have it hauled out of their dock and taken
to a place I found the other side of town, up-river.
Know where Ash Street comes out down there?
Well, about two blocks beyond that. We’d draw
the boat up close to the bank, make her fast, and
build a sort of bridge to the deck. Some of that
stuff in your yard will come in very handy.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be perfect!” declared Polly.
“I didn’t want to mention it, Laurie, but I was
dreadfully afraid that Miss Comfort wouldn’t
want to live down there by the quarry, with the
dynamite shooting off and all those rough-looking
men about!”</p>

<p>“Sounds as if the young fellow’s scheme might
have something in it after all,” allowed Ned.
“Just the same, I’ll bet the quarry folks won’t
give up the boat unless some one pays them for
storage or whatever it’s called.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” said Bob. “Dad’s company
is a pretty good customer just now, and if
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>dad will talk with the head of the firm—”</p>

<p>“He might tell them that he wouldn’t buy any
more of their old stone,” said Mae. “I guess
that would—would bring them around!”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” laughed Ned. “Well,
let’s have a good look at the old ship first.
Maybe she’s fallen to pieces since morning!”</p>

<p>But she hadn’t. They spent a full twenty
minutes aboard her, while Laurie explained and
Polly’s enthusiasm grew by leaps and bounds.
Bob, too, came over to Laurie’s side, and even
Ned, although he still pretended to doubt, was
secretly favorable. As for Mae—well, as Polly
went so went Mae! After they had viewed and
discussed the <i>Pequot Queen</i> to their satisfaction,
Laurie led them back along the river and showed
the place he had selected for the <i>Pequot Queen’s</i>
future moorings. It was a quiet spot, disturbed
by scant traffic along the lane, now that the chain-works
was no longer in operation. Passing
steamers and tugs might infrequently break the
silence with their whistles, and when, further
down, a coal-barge tied up at the wharf, the whir
of the unloading machinery would come softened
by distance. Between the well-nigh unused road
and the water lay a strip of grass and weeds, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
ribbon of rushes, a narrow pebbled beach. Some
sixty feet out a sunken canal-boat exposed her
deck-house above the surface. Six yards or so
from the tiny beach the remains of a wooden bulkhead
stretched. In places the piles alone remained,
but opposite where Laurie had halted his
companions there was a twelve-foot stretch of
planking still spiked to the piles.</p>

<p>“We could bring her up to that bulkhead and
make her fast to the piles at bow and stern. I
figure that there’s just about enough water there
to float her. Then we’d built a sort of bridge
or gangway from the bulkhead to the shore.
She couldn’t get away, and she couldn’t sink.
That old hulk out beyond would act as a sort of
breakwater if there was a storm, too.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a perfectly gorgeous idea,” said
Polly ecstatically. “And just see, Mae, how
very, very quiet and respectable it is here!”</p>

<p>Ned, though, seemed bent on enacting the rôle
of Mr. Spoilsport. “That’s all right,” he said,
“but how are you going to get permission to tie
her up here? This property belongs to some one,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Laurie looked taken aback. “Why, I don’t believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
so, Ned. Here’s the road and here’s the
river. There’s only a few feet—”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” Ned persisted, “some one’s
bound to own as far as high tide.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the folks in the house across the road,”
suggested Mae.</p>

<p>“Mean to tell me,” demanded Laurie, “that
the fellow who left that canal-boat out there had
to ask permission?”</p>

<p>“That’s in deep water,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“So would the <i>Pequot Queen</i> be in deep water!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but your bridge or gangplank
wouldn’t be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks,” said Laurie. “That doesn’t
sound like sense. Does it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess whoever owns this little strip
wouldn’t object to a person landing on it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Polly. “Besides, I
don’t believe it belongs to any one—except the
town or the State of New York or some one like
that!”</p>

<p>“Guess we can find that out easy enough,” said
Laurie, recovering confidence. “Now, what’s
the verdict? Think there’s anything in the
scheme?”</p>

<small>ROMANCE AND MISS COMFORT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They did, even Ned allowing that, if certain
obstacles already indicated by him could be
surmounted, and if Miss Comfort could be persuaded
to adopt a nautical life, the scheme had
merit.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Laurie, “Then the next
thing is to sound out Miss Comfort. You can
do that better than any of the rest of us, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Me? Where do you get that stuff?” demanded
Ned. “It’s your scheme.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t your—your powers of description
and—er—persuasion, old-timer.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” replied Ned implacably.
“I’ll go with you and help out, but it’s your
idea, and you’ve got to spring it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Laurie,” agreed Polly, “I think you can
explain it more clearly than Ned can, because
you’ve thought it all out so wonderfully. But
we’ll all go with you, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” assented Laurie. “Let’s go and
get it over with. I dare say she won’t listen to
it, though.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell,” said Polly. “Miss Comfort
is awfully—well, courageous, Laurie, and she
thinks you’re so wonderful that—”</p>

<p>“Huh,” muttered Ned. “Wonder where she
got that notion.”</p>

<p>“Compared to the poor-farm,” declared Mae,
“I think the <i>Pequot Queen</i> is a perfect paradise!”</p>

<p>“Well, you just mention that to Miss Comfort,
will you?” requested Laurie gloomily as they
started back.</p>

<p>“Guess there’s another thing we haven’t considered,”
said Bob thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked Laurie disgustedly.
“Stealing Ned’s stuff?”</p>

<p>“No, but look here; Miss Comfort will be an
awful long way from folks who buy her cake and
stuff, won’t she? Think they’ll hike way down
here?”</p>

<p>A short silence ensued. Then said Polly,
“That is so, Laurie, but maybe—”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s so,” was the answer, “but will you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
allow me to remind the gentleman that this place
down here is just about a mile and a half nearer
than the poor-farm?”</p>

<p>“Never thought of that,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said Polly cheerfully, “I don’t
believe it will matter much. If folks want Miss
Comfort’s cakes they’ll come for them, or send
for them. As for what we buy, why, I wouldn’t
mind coming for it a mite. It—it’s just a nice
walk!”</p>

<p>They found Mrs. Deane and Miss Comfort having
tea in the sitting-room when they reached the
little blue house, and their errand must needs be
postponed until more cups and saucers and more
sweet crackers had been distributed. At last,
however, with four pair of eyes fixed on him with
embarrassing attentiveness, Laurie set down his
cup, drew a long breath, and broke the moment’s
silence with an explosive “<em>Miss Comfort!</em>”</p>

<p>That poor lady was so startled that she nearly
upset her tea. Laurie plunged on hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you haven’t heard any more from
your brother-in-law, have you?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, no! No, I haven’t, Mr. Laurie.”</p>

<p>“Thought so,” resumed Laurie. “Well, now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
here’s—here’s something that it seemed to me—to
all of us that maybe would be something that
you might sort of take into consideration if nothing
better turned up, because, after all, that poor-farm
isn’t any place for a lady like you, and
being on the water isn’t anything at all if you’re
hitched up tight to the land and know you can’t
sink, which you couldn’t <em>possibly</em>, Miss Comfort,
because there wouldn’t be enough water under
you.”</p>

<p>Laurie paused for breath and realized with
confusion that he had made an extremely poor
start. Miss Comfort looked bewilderedly from
him to Mrs. Deane, to Polly, to Ned, and back to
Laurie. “Sakes alive!” she gasped. “What in
the world is he talking about?”</p>

<p>Mae’s giggle came as a welcome diversion.</p>

<p>“Laurie,” said Polly, “you’ll have to start
right at the beginning, you know.” She turned
to Miss Comfort. “He has a perfectly wonderful
idea, Miss Comfort, and we’re all just crazy
about it. Now, Laurie.”</p>

<p>The interlude had allowed the exponent of the
wonderful idea not only to recover his breath
but to rearrange his thoughts, and now he began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
over and explained very creditably just what the
idea was. Occasionally one of the others threw
in a helpful word, Miss Comfort, who had taken
up her crocheting after setting her tea-cup aside,
soon laid it down. Her face brightened as
Laurie’s idea became clearer to her and her eyes
sparkled more than ever. She leaned forward in
rapt attention, and did not interrupt once. Even
when Laurie had said all he could think of and
Polly had added an enthusiastic postscript, Miss
Comfort said no word for several silent moments.
Then she gave a deep sigh and clasped
her thin hands tightly above her crocheting.</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t have to go to that place!”
she breathed wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Laurie, what did I tell you?” cried Polly
joyously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Deane, “it would be
very nice, Pansy—” three startled gasps followed—“but
would you feel quite—quite <em>at ease</em> on
a <em>boat</em>?”</p>

<p>“I should,” replied Miss Comfort with surprising
emphasis. “I’ve always been fond of
the sea, all my life. Maybe it’s because my
grandfather on my mother’s side was a sea-captain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
That Spode tea-cup that you admired
so much was a part of a set that he brought back
from one of his voyages. Yes, ever since I was
a child I’ve longed for the sea and for ships.
Once I almost took a trip from New York to Fall
River on a steamer, but just at the last moment
mother decided to go by train instead. I was
tragically disappointed. And now to think that
after all these years I’m to—to go to sea!”</p>

<p>“But, you know,” said Ned, breaking the little
silence that followed, “it wouldn’t be exactly
going to sea, Miss Comfort, for, of course, the
boat would be tied to the—the land, and—”</p>

<p>“It would be for me,” replied Miss Comfort
softly. “I’d be living on a boat with the water
all around me. And I could watch the steamers
and the ships come and go. And there’d be the
smell of the salt water all the time, too. Oh, my
dears, I’d love it! It—it sounds far, far too
good to be true, Mr. Laurie. Are you sure that—that
everything can be arranged?”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort felt for a square of linen with
a narrow black border and gently dabbed her
eyes. Laurie felt it his duty to acknowledge that
he wasn’t sure at all, but he did nothing of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
sort. He scowled surreptitiously at Ned and
answered firmly: “Absolutely, Miss Comfort.
There isn’t a doubt!”</p>

<p>And then, to Laurie’s surprise, Ned said just
as convincedly, “It’s as good as fixed right now,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort sighed happily and beamed about
the circle. “Well, I just can’t believe it,” she
said, laughing tremulously at her own emotion.
“Why, I can’t think of anything that would make
me happier than to live on a real boat right on
the water! Just think of going to sleep with the
lapping of the waves all about, and of waking up
in the morning and seeing the blue, blue ocean—no,
I should say river—stretching away and
away! Oh, my dears, there’s romance about the
sea that I’ve always longed to know. Maybe, at
my time of life, I shouldn’t be talking about
romance, but—”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Mrs. Deane vehemently.
“Fiddlesticks, my dear! At your time
of life, indeed!” It seemed to the others that the
Widow might have borrowed Miss Comfort’s
handkerchief and put it to good use. Laurie
cleared his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” he said gruffly. “I guess
folks can enjoy things like that just as much at
eight—sev—sixty as they can any time!” Aware
of Polly’s horrified look, he subsided. Miss Comfort,
though, was far too absorbed in the joyous
prospect to heed.</p>

<p>“I must go and see it,” she went on animatedly.
“Is it very far, Mr. Laurie? I suppose,” she concluded,
with a sigh, “it’s too late to go to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” assented Laurie. “I guess you’d
better wait until to-morrow. It’s quite a walk
for—er—for any one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go down to-morrow morning,” announced
Polly, “every one of us. Yes, you will,
too, mama. I’ll get Miss Billings to tend the
store for an hour. If we start at eight I can get
back in time for school.”</p>

<p>“Eight!” exclaimed Laurie.</p>

<p>“Of course. We’re all through breakfast at
half-past seven, and—”</p>

<p>“But, Polly, maybe that would be too early for
the boys, dear,” interposed her mother. “Perhaps
they don’t have breakfast—”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Mrs. Deane,” said Ned.
“We’ll meet you over at the school corner at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
eight. Laurie was just thinking that perhaps we
ought to start earlier, weren’t you, old son?”</p>

<p>“Er—oh, yes! Sure! Still, eight will do, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s arranged,” said Polly. “Now
let’s talk about the boat some more.”</p>

<p>The next morning they all set out according to
schedule to show Miss Comfort the <i>Pequot Queen</i>.
Laurie had doubts as to the wisdom of this, for
he thought it would have been better if they
could have fixed up the boat a little before exhibiting
it. But, as Polly said, Miss Comfort
would never have waited. Laurie need not have
entertained any uneasiness. Even the river
threw Miss Comfort into a tremor of delight, and
after that she walked so fast that Mrs. Deane had
hard work to keep up with her. When, while still
at a distance, Laurie pointed out the <i>Pequot
Queen</i> with a few stammered words of apology,
Miss Comfort stopped still, clasped her hands,
this morning adorned with black silk mitts, and
gazed long and silently. The boys viewed her
doubtfully and anxiously, but doubt and anxiety
speedily fled, for the little lady’s face expressed
something very close to rapture. The boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
looked away. Ned whistled a few tuneless notes
softly. Then they went on, Miss Comfort walking
faster than ever and saying no word.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Laurie later, “you’ve got to hand
it to her for imagination. Why, when I said to
her, ‘Here’s where the stove goes,’ or ‘You could
put your bureau here, Miss Comfort,’ blessed if
I don’t think she actually saw them there! Once,
after she’d decided to put the kitchen table over
on the further side of the cabin, she was over
there a few minutes later and sort of feeling
around just like she was trying to find the rolling-pin
or something!”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t she pleased?” asked Bob.
“Gosh, you’d have thought we’d presented her
with a million-dollar castle! The old girl is certainly
happy!”</p>

<p>“Cut out the ‘old girl’ stuff,” growled Ned.
“She’s a lady.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I didn’t mean anything, Ned. And as
for being old, gee, I’ve seen a heap of younger
folks that couldn’t have shown half her pep!”</p>

<p>A visit to the town hall obtained for them the
information that the tract of land between road
and river behind the old bulkhead was town property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
and their informant assured them that no
one would object to the contemplated gangway.</p>

<p>Laurie got back to No. 16 alone to discover
Kewpie, sweatered and unkempt of hair, lolling
in the Morris chair and fondling glove and ball.
“Say, where the dickens have you been?”
Kewpie demanded aggrievedly. “I’ve been
waiting hours!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Laurie blankly. “Where—where
did you drop from?”</p>

<p>“Came on the ten twenty, of course. Wanted
to get some work in before dinner. Thought
you’d be all ready for me, too!”</p>

<p>Laurie returned the other’s reproachful gaze
with one even more reproachful, “Oh, gosh,”
he sighed. “I was hoping you’d forget to come
back!”</p>

<small>MR. BROSE WILKINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There seemed nothing for it but to take
Kewpie into their confidence, and this they
did when, after dinner, Ned and Laurie were back
in No. 16. Kewpie, still demanding a work-out
and impatient at delay, proved that he was not
entirely obsessed by baseball. He became quite
excited about Miss Comfort and the <i>Pequot Queen</i>
and demanded to be let in on the affair.</p>

<p>“Got any money?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>Kewpie smiled in an irritatingly superior manner
and showed a purse fairly bulging with bills
and silver coins. “Which,” he observed grandly,
“reminds me that I owe you fellows a trifle.” The
twins accepted payment without demur.</p>

<p>“I asked about money,” said Ned when that
matter had been concluded, “because to get in on
this game, Kewpie, you have to have—er—three
dollars.”</p>

<p>Kewpie’s countenance promptly betrayed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
secret thought that he could remain out and still
manage to survive. Whereupon Laurie added
hastily: “Of course, three dollars makes you a
life member, you understand. You can become
an ordinary member for two.”</p>

<p>Kewpie grinned and disentangled two one-dollar
bills from the wad. Ned accepted them
gravely. “Want a receipt?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like a receipt for your cheek,” responded
Kewpie flippantly. “Bet nobody else
has put in any little old two dollars! Bet nobody
else has put in two bits!”</p>

<p>“The books of the association are always open
to inspection,” replied Ned coldly, pocketing
Kewpie’s contribution.</p>

<p>“All right, Nid. Now, what about some pitching?”</p>

<p>Laurie tottered to his feet. “Come on,” he
sighed. “But, oh, Kewpie darlin’, I rue the day
I first looked on your ugly face!”</p>

<p>Later that day the initial contribution to the
expense fund was augmented by like sums paid
or pledged by the others, and the colossal amount
of twelve dollars resulted. Laurie opined that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
would suffice, since he meant to beg or borrow
whenever possible. In the evening the twins
went over to see Bob’s father, and that gentleman
readily agreed to intercede with the Porter
Quarry Company in their behalf. “I’ll stop
there in the morning, boys, and see Porter himself.
Bob, you stay around the telephone here,
and I’ll call you up about nine.”</p>

<p>And at a little after nine the next morning the
message came. The Porter Quarry Company,
Mr. Starling telephoned, claimed no equity in the
<i>Pequot Queen</i>, and, furthermore, would be extremely
relieved to see the last of her!</p>

<p>Five minutes later Laurie and Bob had set out
to find Mr. Wilkins, who conducted the boat-yard
a quarter of a mile beyond the new location
chosen for the <i>Pequot Queen</i>. There were a pier
and a landing, two weather-stained sheds, piles of
second-hand lumber, and a few boats in various
stages of dissolution. But there was no Mr.
Wilkins, even though they crossed the lane and
adventured to a neighboring house. They had
decided to give up the search for the time when
there came a hail from the river. A small launch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
chugged toward shore, and a man waved to them
from it. They went to meet it. The noisy motor
was stilled, and the man hailed again.</p>

<p>“Looking for dad?” he asked. He was a tall
chap of possibly twenty-two or three years with
copper-red hair that curled closely about his bare
head. His face was long and thin and chiefly remarkable
for a lazy, good-natured, and very wide
smile. The boys explained their errand while the
little launch floated close to the inshore end of the
wharf.</p>

<p>“Dad’s over to Hamlin doing a job of work.
But I can give you a tow. Where’s your
launch?” Bob told him. “Huh?” asked young
Mr. Wilkins, his smile almost fading. “The old
<i>P. Q.</i>? You bought her?” They explained further.
Young Mr. Wilkins looked dubious.
“Don’t know as I’d want to take a chance like
that,” he said. “S’pose the Porter folks had me
pinched. May be all right, fellers, like you say,
but you don’t own her—”</p>

<p>“But we’ve told you that it’s all right,” interrupted
Bob. “We wouldn’t be stealing her, anyhow.
All we want to do is bring her up the river
and tie her up to the bulkhead down there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“That’s so.” The tall youth’s smile broadened
to normal. “All right. When you want
I should do it?”</p>

<p>“Pronto,” said Laurie. “Right off. How
much will you charge for the job?”</p>

<p>Young Mr. Wilkins viewed them swiftly and
shrewdly. “Oh, it ain’t worth more’n five dollars,
I guess,” he answered carelessly.</p>

<p>“I’ll say it isn’t!” exclaimed Bob. “Listen,
please. We’re not selling you the boat. All we
want is a tow.”</p>

<p>The other laughed merrily. “I wouldn’t give
you five dollars for her, feller. Well, how much
do you want to pay?”</p>

<p>Oddly, perhaps, they hadn’t considered the
question before. But Laurie answered quite
promptly, “Two dollars.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the equally prompt reply.
“Jump in!”</p>

<p>Two minutes later the launch was chugging
out into the stream, Laurie and Bob huddled in
the stern seat, with the water rippling past a
scant four inches below the gunwale. The craft
was rather an amazing affair, being not more
than fourteen feet in length and apparently built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
of odds and ends. No two planks seemed the
same width, while, as for length, they were anywhere
from two feet to ten. Water trickled in
from innumerable seams. The engine was a
diminutive thing of one cylinder, with a fly-wheel
scarcely larger than a good-sized dinner-plate, but
it pushed the boat along at a good gait, the boat
shaking and trembling at every explosion in the
cylinder. The skipper, seated on an empty box
by the engine, laughed.</p>

<p>“How do you like her?” he asked. “Some
cruiser, eh? I knocked her together two, three
years ago. Got that engine out of a yacht dinghy
that sank over by Eagle Beak one time. She’s
sort of wet underfoot, but she generally gets
there. You fellers from Hillman’s?”</p>

<p>Bob said they were.</p>

<p>“Fine man, the Doctor. Used to work for him
sometimes when I was in high school. Mowed
grass and so on a couple of summers. My
name’s Ambrose Wilkins. Called Brose generally.
What sort of a baseball team you fellers
going to have up there this year?” He gave a
negligent tug at the tiller-line and swerved
around the stern of a tug that was backing out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
from the coal-wharf with a lighter snuggled beside
her.</p>

<p>“Why, pretty good, I reckon,” answered
Laurie.</p>

<p>Brose Wilkins’s grin broadened more. “Guess
you weren’t up there when we played you that
twenty-two to three game. Course not. That
was five years ago. That was some game, boys.
Hillman’s didn’t get a hit until the fifth and
didn’t put a run over until the eighth. Then our
in-field went flooey for a minute, and your crowd
piled in three runs. Some game!”</p>

<p>“Did you play?” asked Laurie.</p>

<p>Brose nodded and squirted some oil in the general
direction of the little engine. “Yeah,” he
answered. “Pitched.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, you must have been good,” replied
Laurie.</p>

<p>“Fair,” the other acknowledged modestly.
“That would have been a shut-out if a couple of
our in-fielders hadn’t cracked.”</p>

<p>Laurie stared intently at the <i>Pequot Queen</i>,
now less than two hundred yards away. After a
moment he asked idly, “Do you still play ball?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I pitch for the Lambert team, over to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Munroe. At least, I been pitching for them.
There’s a team down at Carmel that’s written me
a couple of times lately. Guess they’ll make me
an offer soon. I got twenty a game from the
Lamberts, but I guess this Carmel crowd’ll do
better.”</p>

<p>“Twenty dollars a game?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yeah. ’Tain’t much, of course, but it helps.
Besides, I like to play ball, and there ain’t so
much doing up here that dad can’t tend to it once
a week. Well, here’s the old <i>P. Q.</i> Gee-whillikins,
fellers, I remember when this old scow
was a regular lady! Say, what you guys meaning
to do with her, anyway?”</p>

<p>“That’s a long story,” evaded Laurie.</p>

<p>“All right. None of my business, eh? Reach
under that seat, will you, and pull out that coil of
rope.”</p>

<p>No one paid any attention as the <i>Pequot
Queen’s</i> weather-grayed hawsers were cast off
and, with Laurie and Bob at the bow, the long idle
craft moved slowly from the dock. Until the last
moment Laurie had feared that some officious
employee of the quarry company would object,
and he breathed freely when the boat was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
clear of the little harbor and her broad nose had
been pointed up-stream. She moved sluggishly
since, as Brose Wilkins remarked, she probably
had enough water under her deck to fill a pond.
“Water-line’s ’most a foot under,” said Brose,
“but she’ll come all right as soon as she gets
started.” The boys thought the three-quarter-inch
manila rope that Brose was using as a tow
line perilously weak, but it proved quite equal to
its purpose. At first the little one-lung engine
threatened to throb itself into junk in its effort
to move the <i>Pequot Queen</i>, but gradually the
larger craft got under way, imperceptibly at first,
and the voyage up the river began. It was slow
going, but the tiny launch never faltered, and the
<i>Pequot Queen</i>, having, as it seemed, finally made
up her mind to say good-by to her old home and
set forth on an exciting adventure, displayed a
cheerful willingness to follow this new acquaintance.</p>

<p>On the coal-wharf a half-dozen workers paused
in their labors and stared incredulously. One
shouted a question, and after that the <i>Pequot
Queen</i> wallowed leisurely past to a chorus of
ribald comments. In answer Laurie, seated on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the bow rail, waved a nonchalant hand. Further
along other denizens of the waterfront stood and
stared at the sight. That they were causing a
tremendous sensation was quite evident to the
passengers on the old ferry-boat, and, boy-like,
they enjoyed it thoroughly. Laurie regretted
that they hadn’t brought a flag and run it up
on the short staff beside them!</p>

<p>Getting the <i>Pequot Queen</i> into her new berth
was far more difficult than persuading her to
leave her old home. She had to be taken past the
sunken canal-boat without running her bow on the
bottom, and that task required patience and ingenuity.
But Brose Wilkins was equal to it, and
finally, after much tugging and swinging and
shoving—the <i>Pequot Queen’s</i> steering apparatus
was no longer of use—the battered old craft was
lying against the short stretch of bulkhead. That
her rail smashed off the upper plank of the bulkhead
was immaterial, since it allowed her to get
a few inches nearer. That the boys had neglected
to bring anything to tie the boat up with complicated
matters at first. They had not brought
the old hawsers along since they had been uncertain
whether they had been the property of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
boat’s former owners or of the quarry company.
In any case, those rotted ropes would have been
of only temporary use. Laurie offered to run
over to a store and get some new line, but Brose
vetoed that suggestion.</p>

<p>“You fellers hold her here a few minutes,” he
said. “We’ve got some second-hand stuff over
in the shed that’ll do fine and won’t cost you but
a few cents. All we need is about thirty feet at
each end.” He chugged off, leaving the boys sitting
on the rail of the boat with their legs dangling
over the bulkhead planking. The <i>Pequot
Queen</i> showed no desire to leave her new home.
In fact, she seemed more desirous of pushing her
way right up on the beach, and Laurie audibly
wondered whether they hadn’t better somehow
strengthen the bulkhead.</p>

<p>“I guess she’ll be all right when she’s once
tied up,” said Bob. “We’ll ask the Wilkins
chap when he comes back.”</p>

<p>Brose allayed their fears as he climbed aboard
the <i>Pequot Queen</i> with a supply of thick hawser.
“She won’t budge when we get her fixed,” he
assured them. “Ease her off a bit while I stick
these fenders over the side.” The fenders were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
two sausage-shaped canvas bags attached to short
lengths of cord, and he inserted them between
bulkhead and boat about ten feet apart, making
the free ends of the cords fast under the low rail.
“They won’t cost you anything,” he said.
“They’re worn out. All right for this job,
though. Now let’s see.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the <i>Pequot Queen</i> was fast,
bow and stern, the worn but still serviceable hawsers
securely tied to two spiles. “There,” said
Brose. “She’ll stay put till the Yankees win the
World’s Championship, fellers!”</p>

<p>“We’re awfully much obliged to you,” said
Laurie gratefully. “You’ve been mighty decent.
Now, how much is it, rope and all?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars and seventy-five cents,” answered
Brose. “But I’ll throw off the seventy-five
cents if you’ll tell me what in the name of
Old Joe Barnes you’re aiming to do with her
now you’ve got her!”</p>

<p>Laurie questioned Bob silently, and, because
they had taken a sudden and immense liking to
the queer, loose-jointed, red-haired Brose, Bob
nodded. So Laurie told him the whole story, and
Brose Wilkins’s eyes opened wide and his broad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
smile threatened to jostle his ears while he
listened. Once or twice he chuckled, too. And
when Laurie had finished he laughed until tears
stood in his gray eyes. Laurie frowned then.
He supposed it did sound rather funny, but
Brose’s laughter lasted too long. It wasn’t <em>that</em>
funny! Then, just when Laurie was forming a
stinging rebuke in his mind, Brose wiped his
streaming eyes with a sleeve of his old brown
sweater and became coherent. He had previously
attempted without success to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, if that don’t beat the Cubs!” he gasped.
“I got to hand it to you fellers for using the old
bean! And, say, what about Miss Pansy, eh?
Ain’t she running true to form? I’ll say she is!
You can’t beat that little woman, fellers. She’s
plucky, she is! Think of her living down here all
by her lonesome, and tickled to do it because
she’s on a boat! Funny, eh? And sporting, too,
eh? She’s a wonder, Miss Pansy is!”</p>

<p>“You know her then?” asked Laurie, mollified.</p>

<p>“Know her? Know Miss Pansy Comfort?
Known her since I was that high.” Brose swept
a hand along about six inches from the deck.
“Used to be in her Sunday-school class. Done odd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
jobs for her when I was a kid, often. Shingled
the shed roof for her not more’n four years ago.
Sure, I know her. Guess every one does. I
heard something about her having to leave that
house up there, but I didn’t know she was up
against it like that. Well, say!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think she’d get on all right here?”
asked Laurie anxiously. “I’ve been thinking
that it’ll be sort of lonely here at night for her.”</p>

<p>“She’ll get on. Trust her. She’s plucky.
Anyway, no one would trouble her. Why, gee-whillikins,
I’ll look out for her myself! I’m
going past here all times, land or water, and I’ll
keep the old eagle eye peeled sharp. Another
thing. You say you’re going to fix this old ark
up a bit. You’d have to, of course. Well, that’s
where I come in, eh? I’m sort of handy with
tools, and I’d like mighty well to help. What say,
fellers?”</p>

<p>“Gosh,” answered Laurie joyfully, “I say
‘Sure!’ That’ll be simply corking. And maybe
you’ve got some tools?”</p>

<p>“Tools? Yeah. Or if I ain’t I can get them.
When you aiming to get at her and what you
aiming to do?”</p>

<small>THE FUND GROWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They parted from Brose Wilkins half an
hour later. The work of fixing up the
<i>Pequot Queen</i> for Miss Comfort’s accommodation
seemed shorn of all difficulties. They were to
start in the morning on the gangway between boat
and shore, Bob supplying the material and Brose
the tools. “Better get that up first,” said the
latter, “so’s you can get aboard without wading.
You don’t need to bring much material, fellers.
There’s a pile of second-hand stuff over on our
wharf we can make use of. Don’t forget the
spikes, though. I ain’t got any spikes. Well,
see you fellers again.”</p>

<p>Brose pushed off the launch with a foot, jumped
nimbly aboard, and waved a long, lean hand.
And just then Laurie remembered something.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” he called. “We haven’t paid
you!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said Brose. “It won’t be but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
seventy-five cents, anyway; just the worth of that
hawser. That tow ain’t going to cost anything
now I know who I done it for!”</p>

<p>The launch broke into sound and disappeared
momentarily around the stern of the <i>Pequot
Queen</i>. When they saw it again Brose was
draped over the little engine, squirting oil.</p>

<p>I fear that Laurie begrudged Kewpie the two
sessions of pitching-practice that day. Certain
it is that the afternoon session was shortened to
a scant thirty minutes, after which four boys set
forth on a shopping expedition, armed with a list
that Laurie had made after dinner. Still later
they joined Polly and Mae at the shop. Progress
was reported and plans for the next day laid.
Then Bob treated the crowd, Kewpie virtuously
choosing a ginger-ale.</p>

<p>To their disappointment, a light rain was falling
that Thursday morning when the four boys
set forth for the <i>Pequot Queen</i>. Ned trundled a
wheelbarrow laden with lumber, and the others
each carried a couple of two-by fours or planks.
Ned’s load also included a paper bag of iron
spikes, two hammers, and a hatchet. They chose
Ash Street in preference to the busier thoroughfares<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
and, because the lumber on the wheelbarrow
was continually falling off and the burdens on the
boys’ shoulders required frequent shifting, their
progress was slow. The rain wasn’t hard, but
it was steady, and Ned, who had arisen in a depressed
state of mind, grumbled alternately at the
weather and the wheelbarrow. They scarcely expected
to find Brose Wilkins on hand when they
reached the boat, but there he was awaiting them.
Laurie introduced Ned and Kewpie, and work
began.</p>

<p>By eleven o’clock a gangway led from the bank
to the deck of the <i>Pequot Queen</i>. Or, if you liked,
you could call it a bridge. It was twenty-six feet
in length and thirty-two inches wide, and it was
supported midway by two posts which Brose had
driven into the sand. It was railed on each side
so that, even in the dark, Miss Comfort could
traverse it safely. Later it was to be painted,
the planking green and the hand-rails white. At
least, that was what Brose said, and since Brose
seemed to have taken command of operations no
one doubted the assertion. Ned and Kewpie, who
had been to Walnut Street on an errand, arrived
just as the last plank was laid, and the five drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
up on the bank and admired the gangway. Of
course, as the material was all second-hand, the
job didn’t possess the fine appearance that new
lumber lends. A stern critic might even have
sneered at the joinery, for Brose Wilkins worked
with speed rather than accuracy, and the gangway
reminded Laurie a little of Brose’s launch. But
it was strong and practical, and none of the admirers
were inclined to be fastidious. On the
contrary the boys were loud in commendation,
even Laurie and Bob, who had wielded saw and
hammer under Brose’s direction, praised the result
highly. Then they all walked along it to the
deck and solemnly and approvingly walked back
again to the shore. As Bob said proudly, it
didn’t even creak.</p>

<p>They spent an hour clearing the boat of the
worst of the dirt and rubbish, preparatory to the
more careful going over to follow in the afternoon,
and finally they parted from Brose and
climbed the hill again.</p>

<p>There was no pitching-practice that forenoon.</p>

<p>Shortly after half-past one they went to Mrs.
Deane’s, reported progress to Miss Comfort, borrowed
two pails, a broom, a scrubbing-brush, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
a mop, and returned to the scene of their labors.
Brose was again ahead of them. He had taken
down the smoke-stack and was covering the hole
in the roof with a piece of zinc sheeting. “I was
thinking,” he explained, “that she might want to
use this place for something, and there was a lot
of water coming in around that old funnel. After
I paint around the edges of this it’ll be tight.”
Brose drove a last flat-headed nail and swung his
legs over the side of the boiler-room. “I was
thinking that maybe she’d like to keep a few hens
in here.”</p>

<p>“<em>Hens!</em>” cried the quartet below in incredulous
chorus.</p>

<p>Brose nodded. “Yeah, she was always fond of
hens, Miss Pansy. Used to have quite a lot of
’em until her fences got sort of bad and they took
to wandering into other folks’ yards. There
wouldn’t be much trouble here, I guess. They
could go ashore and wander as much as they
pleased and not hurt anything.”</p>

<p>Ned broke into laughter. “Can’t you see Miss
Comfort’s hens filing ashore every morning with
a big red rooster in the lead?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Brose. “Put up half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
nests and a couple of roosts across here and
you’d have a fine chicken-house. Anyhow, no
harm in stopping the leak.”</p>

<p>“I dare say she can use it for something, anyhow,”
said Laurie.</p>

<p>“If it was me,” said Kewpie, “I’d keep ducks.
Look at all the water they’d have!”</p>

<p>For better than an hour dust flew from bow to
stern on the <i>Pequot Queen</i>, and the scrape of the
scrubbing-brush and the slap of the mop sounded
from cabin, deck, and wheel-house. To introduce
water into the boiler room would have made matters
only worse there, for the floor and even the
walls were black with coal-dust. They cleaned
out the fire-box and used the broom repeatedly
and closed the doors on the scene. But by four
o’clock the rest of the boat was thoroughly clean,
and only sunlight and warmth were needed to
complete the work. The rather worn linoleum
on the cabin floor looked very different after
Bob’s scrubbing brush and Kewpie’s mop had got
through with it. Even the paint in there had
been won back to a fair semblance of whiteness.
By that time Polly and Mae, released from school,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
had also arrived, and the <i>Pequot Queen</i> resounded
to eager voices. The rain had ceased and beyond
the hills westward the gray clouds were breaking
when, carrying pails and mop, broom and brush,
the party of six went back to the shop in merry
mood.</p>

<p>It had been very hard to keep Miss Comfort
away from her new home thus far, and, since
they wanted to have everything in shape before
she saw it, they didn’t recount to her all that
had been accomplished. “You see, ma’am,” said
Laurie, “she was pretty dirty, and—”</p>

<p>“But I’ll attend to the cleaning,” declared
Miss Comfort eagerly. “Land sakes, I don’t expect
you boys to do that!”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, well, now you take that hen—I
mean boiler-room. That wouldn’t be any sort
of work for you.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t seem right to let you young
folks do so much. Why, just look at the boy’s
shoes! They’re soaking wet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kewpie doesn’t mind that, Miss Comfort.
Besides, I guess it’s just outside that’s wet.
Isn’t it, Kewpie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>Kewpie moved his foot once or twice experimentally
and obtained a gentle squishing sound.
He nodded. “That’s all,” he said.</p>

<p>“But,” resumed Laurie, “I guess we’ll have
everything ready for you by Saturday noon. I
thought we might get the stove down that morning
and put it up. Then, maybe, on Monday you
could move in!”</p>

<p>“You don’t think I could get settled Saturday?”
pleaded Miss Comfort. “I’d so love to
spend Sunday in my—my new home.”</p>

<p>Laurie silently consulted the others and read
assent. “Why, yes, ma’am, I think we could
have everything all ready by, say, half-past ten or
eleven.”</p>

<p>“That would be much nicer,” exclaimed Polly,
“for then we could all help get the things arranged.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” cried Miss Comfort gratefully.
“To-morrow I’ll engage Peter Brown to
move my things Saturday morning. And to think
that it won’t be to the poor-farm! I told Mr.
Grierson yesterday about it. He’s one of the
overseers, you know. He seemed—almost—almost
put out, and I thought for a moment he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
going to insist on my going to that place after
all.” Miss Comfort laughed softly. “He said
he had been ‘counting on me.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Laurie, “you go ahead
and arrange for the team for Saturday at about
ten thirty, and we’ll see that the place is all
ready, won’t we, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, we will, Miss Comfort, even if
we have to—to work all night! Mae and I don’t
have to go to school again for a week after to-morrow,
and we can do lots of things for you,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done so much already, my dear, all
of you!” Miss Comfort sighed, but it was a happy
sigh. “I don’t know how to thank you, I’m sure.
It does seem as if—as if—” She faltered then,
and before she could continue Laurie got to his
feet somewhat noisily and the others followed
suit.</p>

<p>“Got to go along,” he said hurriedly. “Change
Kewpie’s feet—shoes, I mean. Might take cold.
See you in the morning, folks.”</p>

<p>Laurie made his escape, followed by the others,
sighing relief. Outside on the bricks, Kewpie’s
shoes <em>squished</em> beautifully, but Kewpie was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
frowning. “I like the old soul,” he announced,
“but, say, she’s awful leaky around the eyes!”</p>

<p>“So you’d be if you were seventy years old
and folks were—were kind to you and—and all
that sort of thing,” replied Laurie gruffly and
vaguely. “Folks get that way when they’re old;
sort of grateful and tearful. They can’t help it,
I guess!”</p>

<p>It was still well short of supper-time, and so
they stopped at Bob’s to see the tennis-court.
The surface layer was almost finished, and two
sturdy posts for the net, startlingly, shiningly
green, had been sunk. While they admired, Mr.
Starling joined them from the house, and Laurie
thanked him for his assistance with the quarry
company.</p>

<p>“Glad to have helped, Laurie,” replied Bob’s
father. “And that reminds me. Seen the pear-trees?”</p>

<p>“Pear-trees? No, sir. Not to—to notice
them.”</p>

<p>“Come and look at them.” Mr. Starling led
Laurie around the corner of the new court and
along the further walk to where a few fruit-trees,
their branches still bare, occupied one corner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
the garden. Laurie viewed the trees interestedly,
but failed to note anything remarkable, and he
turned to his guide for enlightenment. Mr.
Starling was selecting two bills from a long black
wallet, keeping his back to the others. He thrust
the bills into Laurie’s hand.</p>

<p>“We’d like to help a little, my sister and I,”
he said. “Use that in any way you like, Laurie,
but you needn’t say where it came from. If you
need more, let me know.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t really need it, sir,” protested
the boy. “We’ve got twelve dollars, and I don’t
believe—”</p>

<p>“Put it in your pocket,” insisted Mr. Starling.
“You can find some way of using it for Miss
Comfort’s—er—comfort!” He raised his voice.
“Look promising, don’t they? Lots of fruit this
year, I guess. Thomas is quite a gardener, if
you take his word for it.” He turned Laurie
about with a hand on his shoulder and paced back
toward the others. “We feel sort of sorry for
that little woman,” he added, lowering his voice
again. “Hard to pull up stakes at her age, I
guess. Ought to do what we can for her, Laurie.
Come to me again if you need some more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>At supper Dr. Hillman asked the twins to come
to his study, and there he produced a pink slip
of paper from a desk drawer and handed it to
Laurie. “My sister and I have wanted to help
ever since we first learned of Miss Comfort’s—ah—embarrassment,
but have been somewhat at
a loss to know how to do so. She is greatly
averse to anything resembling charity, as you
probably know. To-day we heard of your interest
in the matter, Laurence, and of your—ah—ingenious
solution of the lady’s problem, and it
occurred to us that if we handed a small contribution
to you you would doubtless be able to use it to
advantage and at the same time—ah—consider it
confidential.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five more!” exclaimed Laurie when
they were back in No. 16. “Forty from Mr. Starling.
Seventy-seven in all! What’ll we do
with it?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know!” replied Ned, “unless we
install steam heat and open plumbing!”</p>

<small>MISS COMFORT COMES ABOARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Behold the <i>Pequot Queen</i> at ten o’clock
Saturday morning!</p>

<p>She is freshly painted from end to end on the
shoreward side, gleaming white, with bright yellow
trim. The other side is to be done later.
Just now the painter, a sure-enough professional
painter from Joyce &amp; Connell’s, is finishing the
upper deck.</p>

<p>The gangway is resplendent, too, for Brose did
that himself yesterday, using plenty of drier.
The deck is protected by bits of board to walk on,
although by evening the buff paint will be hard
enough. The doors are to have a second coat
later, but as they are they look pretty fine. Wonderful
what paint will do, isn’t it? You’d hardly
think this was the same old <i>Pequot Queen</i>.</p>

<p>But there’s the cabin yet. Linoleum shining
with new varnish, walls and ceiling creamy white,
blue and white curtains at the windows, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Comfort’s old stove blackened and polished by
Kewpie until you’d never suspect it was not
brand-new! And that’s a real sink in the corner,
even though it isn’t working yet. You just
can’t hurry a plumber! There’ll be a pump
alongside, of course. Miss Comfort will get her
drinking-water at the Parmenter’s across the
road. They’re real friendly folks. Mr. Parmenter
hauled the coal that’s in the bin in the
boiler-room himself. That shelving is all new.
Brose and Bob put that up. The hanging lamp
in the center is one Mrs. Deane had. Miss Starling
sent those flowers. Looks pretty nice,
doesn’t it? Wouldn’t mind living here yourself?
Well, neither would I! And look at the
view from those windows; sun sparkling on the
water, boats passing! Think Miss Comfort’ll
like it?</p>

<p>That was a busy, bustling morning. As early
as Ned and Laurie and Kewpie reached the
<i>Pequot Queen</i>, Polly and Mae and Brose Wilkins
were before them. Although much had been accomplished
yesterday, much remained to be done.
Bob arrived an hour later, bearing a box of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
flowers from his aunt. Brose, singing as he
worked, dropped his hammer to touch up a spot
with a paint-brush, abandoned paint-brush to
seize again on hammer or screw-driver. Kewpie,
eager for employment, got in every one’s way
and accumulated a great deal of fresh white pigment
every time he turned around. The plumber,
having set the sink up, went away, and the awning
man arrived to take measurements. The
awning was to cover the rear half of the roof-deck.
There had once been an awning all over
the roof, and, although the frame had disappeared,
the sockets into which the uprights had
been screwed remained. To put an awning over
the whole roof-deck was beyond their means, but
they could well afford to protect half of it. Brose
was going to make two flower-boxes to fit the
benches along the railing and fill them with earth
so that, when summer came, Miss Comfort would
have a veritable roof-garden up there. Brose
thought of all sorts of things, practical and otherwise.
One of the practical things was a place
to dry clothes on the small deck forward, where
he stretched four lengths of line from a post set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
in the flag-pole socket at the extreme bow to four
galvanized iron hooks screwed to the front of the
wheel-house.</p>

<p>At eleven Peter Brown arrived with Miss Comfort’s
worldly belongings. Peter was small and
very black; Peter’s horse was small and presumably
white; and Peter’s wagon was small and
extremely ramshackle. How he managed to get
so much on it was a question! A narrow black
walnut bedstead in several sections, together with
its appurtenances; a drop-leaf mahogany table;
a funny old trunk with a rounded top; five chairs
of assorted shapes and sizes; a packing-case of
cooking-utensils; a barrel of china and crockery;
a walnut what-not; a wash-boiler filled with miscellany;
a marble clock wrapped in a patchwork
quilt; some books; three pictures in faded gilt
frames; a huge bundle of bedding; a roll of frayed
straw matting; some braided rugs; a spotless deal
table and various other smaller sundries.</p>

<p>Peter and Brose unloaded at the end of the
gangway, and the boys bore the things aboard.
In the cabin Polly and Mae directed the bestowing
of them, wiping everything clean with a dust-cloth
as it was set in place. The packing-case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
was left on deck, as was the barrel, but the rest
of the things went inside, and when they were
all there there was just room for the two girls
to move cautiously about!</p>

<p>But half an hour later there was another tale
to tell. The cooking-utensils were hung on nails,
the dishes were on the shelves, the bed was set
up and dressed, the trunk was under the deal
table, the rugs were on the floor, the pictures
were hung, the drop-leaf table stood under the
hanging lamp, and order had emerged from chaos.
Of course, as Polly acknowledged, the place did
look a trifle crowded, but she guessed Miss Comfort
wouldn’t mind. Two articles alone defeated
their efforts, the what-not and the marble clock.
The what-not, built to fit in a corner, looked sadly
out of place at the foot of the bed, and the marble
clock simply cried aloud for a mantel to rest on.
But the corners were all occupied, and there was
no mantel; and so the what-not remained where
they had put it, and the clock for the time being
reposed on a window-sill.</p>

<p>Brose hustled the empty case and barrel to the
boiler-room, which compartment held also a supply
of kindling-wood and a quarter of a ton of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
coal and so didn’t look one bit like a hen-house!
Miss Comfort was to have an early lunch at Mrs.
Deane’s, and she and the Widow were to arrive
at the boat about half-past twelve. At exactly
twelve Polly flipped her dust-cloth for the last
time, the painter stowed his belongings in the
wheel-house and called it a day, Brose relinquished
his hammer, and seven satisfied and
hungry workers gave their attention to the luncheon
that the girls had prepared. To have dined
at school would have prevented the twins and
Kewpie from being on hand at Miss Comfort’s
arrival, and they didn’t want to miss that!</p>

<p>There was plenty to eat, and full justice was
done to the viands. It was a jolly, happy meal,
too, for the <i>Pequot Queen</i> looked as none of them
had ever hoped to see it look, and, as Brose remarked,
it would look a sight better before they
got through with it. “When the awning’s up
and there’s flowers along the rail there— What
color’s the awning, Laurie?”</p>

<p>“Red and white.”</p>

<p>“Great! And then there’ll be little window-boxes
under the two windows on this side. I’m
going to paint ’em white with green crisscrosses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
on ’em; sort of lattice-effect, you know. And
then I was thinking this morning that it wouldn’t
be hard to make a little flower-bed on each side
of the bridge there later. I could plant
morning-glories or something so’s they’d climb
along on the hand-rail. And some bright things,
too, like geraniums or zinnias.”</p>

<p>“Brose,” exclaimed Laurie, “you’re a wonder!”
He held aloft a paper cup filled with hot
chocolate. “Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Mr. Brose Wilkins, without whose assistance—no,
directorship this undertaking would have been
a—but a partial success. To his untiring zeal
and—er—”</p>

<p>“There they come!” cried Kewpie excitedly.</p>

<p>And there they did come, Miss Comfort in her
best black dress—and probably her only black
dress—and Mrs. Deane, Miss Comfort at least a
yard in advance, Mrs. Deane trying hard to recover
the distance. Polly jumped to the rail and
“yoo-hooed” and waved. Miss Comfort heard
and, it seemed, saw the <i>Pequot Queen</i> for the first
time. She stopped short and stared from a half-block
away. Mrs. Deane regained her lost
ground and stared, too. For a long moment the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
two stood motionless there. Then Miss Comfort
started on again, this time at a funny little half-trot.
Once more Mrs. Deane was outdistanced!</p>

<p>Polly and Ned and Bob ran across the gangway
to meet them. The others remained on deck,
Kewpie grinning broadly, Laurie only half smiling,
Mae emitting little whispered ejaculations,
and Brose, his comforting hammer once more in
hand, humming a funny sort of tune under his
breath. Miss Comfort’s face was a study as she
paused at the end of the gangway and swept the
scene with rapt gaze. Then, still silent, she declined
Ned’s offered assistance and walked firmly
and proudly across the gangway and stepped
down upon her own deck!</p>

<p>It was not until she stood at the cabin door and
looked inside that the little lady became articulate.
Then she drew a deep breath and said,
“<em>Well, I never!</em>” in a voice that was scarcely
more than a whisper. Then she was inside, with
the others clustering about her and every one
talking at once, Polly apologizing for the clock,
Mae explaining about the what-not, Laurie promising
water for the sink not later than Tuesday,
Mrs. Deane exclaiming repeatedly to no one in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
particular: “Why, I had no idea! I simply had
no idea!”</p>

<p>After a moment or two Miss Comfort seated
herself in the walnut rocker with the gray horsehair
upholstering and sighed again. “It’s too
beautiful for words,” she said. She reached out
for Polly’s hand and drew it to her, patting it
with little quick gestures. “I never thought it
would be like this, my dear, never, never! I just
can’t find any words to thank you all; not now;
perhaps some day—” She searched for and
found her tiny black-bordered handkerchief.
Kewpie frowned and turned toward a window.
Gee, she was getting leaky again! But, as before,
Laurie provided a diversion.</p>

<p>“Here’s the fellow that did more than the rest
of us put together,” he said. Miss Comfort
looked, and—</p>

<p>“Why, Brose Wilkins!” she cried. “You, too!
Why, I didn’t see you!” Brose shook hands, his
broad smile again threatening his ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Pansy, it’s me,” he said. “But
you don’t want to believe what Laurie tells you.
I ain’t done much but swing a hammer. Now,
how you feeling, ma’am?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“Very happy, Brose,” replied Miss Comfort
softly. “Happier than a person has any right to
be at my time of life, I guess. Isn’t it wonderful?”
Her gaze swept over the little white room
with its blue and white curtains aflutter in the
sunlit breeze and all her friendly belongings
about. “Doesn’t the picture of grandfather’s
ship look beautifully there, Brose?”</p>

<p>Brose agreed that it did. Every one else
agreed that it did. Secretly, however, Bob, who
had hung the article, told himself that that representation
of a barkantine with all sails set plowing
through a muddy-green sea had probably
been done by the village sign-painter!</p>

<p>After that Miss Comfort arose and minutely inspected
every inch of her domain, listening to
Laurie’s somewhat involved explanation of the
water system not yet installed, to Ned’s story
of the roof-garden above, to Polly’s reason for
placing the wash-boiler here and the knife-board
there, and to Mae’s confidences regarding the
whereabouts of the linen. Then she was taken
off along the deck to see where the coal and wood
were kept. At intervals Laurie took a slip of
paper from a pocket and surreptitiously wrote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
on it. When they reached the boiler-room he
added the mysterious word “coal scuttle” to several
other words already on the paper.</p>

<p>In due course they all returned to the cabin and
sat or stood around and did a good deal of talking
and exclaiming and laughing until, at last,
Mrs. Deane jumped up suddenly and announced
in a shocked voice that she must get right back
and that she didn’t know what Miss Billings
would be thinking of her! That began a general
exodus. Polly said that she and Mae would be
down after supper to see if everything was all
right. She had already offered to remain during
the afternoon, but Miss Comfort had almost
pathetically declined the offer. Miss Comfort, as
was evident to all, wanted to be left quite alone
for a while.</p>

<p>“You’re sure you won’t be nervous at night,”
asked Mrs. Deane anxiously, “all alone here like
this.”</p>

<p>“Nervous?” repeated Miss Comfort placidly.
“Not a bit. No more than I was in that empty
house up there. I never was one of the scary
kind, and down here, with the friendly water
around me, I’ll never be lonesome again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll be looking in now and then,” said Brose.
“I’m liable to be passing most any time, Miss
Pansy, and, whenever you want anything just let
me know.”</p>

<p>“And to-morrow,” said Mae, “we’re all coming
down to call on you in your new home, Miss
Comfort.”</p>

<p>“Do, my dear, do! Come to-morrow afternoon,
and I’ll make some tea for you. In the
morning, of course, I’ll be at church.”</p>

<p>“Church?” said Mrs. Deane. “I wouldn’t try
it unless I felt real well, my dear. It’s a long
walk and a real steep one.”</p>

<p>“All the better,” replied Miss Comfort. “All
my life I’ve lived so close to the church that it
wasn’t any effort at all. Sometimes I think that
if religion wasn’t made so easy for us we’d think
more of it. ’Twon’t do me a mite of harm to
have to walk a little on a Sunday in order to worship
the Lord. And I guess maybe He will approve
of it.”</p>

<p>Going back, Laurie, walking beside Polly, said
with a relieved sigh: “Gee, I was glad to get
away without having her ask questions, Polly! I
thought every minute she’d want to know where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
everything came from and how we had paid for
it!”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Polly thoughtfully. “It’s sort
of queer she didn’t, too. Because she must
know that white-enameled sinks and pumps and
awnings and such things don’t just <em>happen</em>.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose she just doesn’t stop to
think,” mused Laurie. “And I hope she won’t.
It would be fierce if she got insulted and went to
the poor-farm after all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, she wouldn’t do that!” declared Polly
in horror. After a moment she added: “I’ll
just bet you anything, Laurie, that she did notice
and that she means to ask! She’s just waiting
until she can speak to you alone, I believe.”</p>

<p>Laurie groaned. “Then she’s never going to
get the chance,” he muttered. Polly looked
doubtful.</p>

<small>LAURIE IS CORNERED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The following afternoon saw the boys, minus
Kewpie, escorting Polly and Mae to the
<i>Pequot Queen</i>. Mrs. Deane had begged off. One
mustn’t expect all April days to be fine, and this
particular day proved it. It had showered off
and on during the forenoon, and now, at half-past
three, the rain was coming down hard and
fast. The girls wore rain-coats over their Sunday
gowns, and Ned and Laurie were draped in
colorful yellow oilskins. Bob, in an old Mackinaw
jacket, huddled under the dripping eaves of
one of the two umbrellas. It seemed a particularly
long way to the <i>Pequot Queen</i> under these
circumstances, and it was a rather bedraggled
quintet that at last filed into the cabin. Once
there, however, discomforts were forgotten. A
fire in the stove defied the dampness of the outside
world; a kettle sang cozily; the white light
that entered the open windows flashed on polished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
surfaces; and the bowl of flowers on the
table added a cheerful note of color. And then
there was the little hostess, all smiles of welcome
and concerned murmurs over dripping coats and
wet skirts.</p>

<p>The coats were laid aside quickly, and the visitors
found seats, Polly and Mae occupying the
same arm-chair, since there were but five chairs
in the cabin and not even Laurie would have
thought of sitting on Miss Comfort’s immaculate
blue and white spread! The lack of a sixth
chair troubled Miss Comfort considerably. Bob
pointed out that even had she possessed such a
thing there wouldn’t have been room for it and
some one would have had to sit out on deck! And
Polly and Mae assured in chorus that they didn’t
<em>mind</em> sitting together, not one <em>bit</em>.</p>

<p>Miss Comfort was brimming over with pride
and happiness. Everything was too wonderful
for words! And sleep— She held up her hands
in something almost like consternation. Why,
she hadn’t slept the way she had slept last night
for years and years! She had had her supper
late because she had been so busy fixing things
up, and then she had sat at the window there for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
a long time watching the lights on the water and
on the further shore; and suddenly she couldn’t
keep her eyes open a minute longer, it had seemed,
and she had gone to bed and fallen right to sleep
and slept and slept!</p>

<p>“It was so wonderful lying there and listening
to the water lapping against the boat that I tried
my best to keep awake. But I couldn’t. And
then this morning when I awoke there was a
beautiful fog and I could hear bells sounding and
now and then a great, deep fog-horn on some boat.
It was perfect! From my bed I can look out of
the windows and see the river, and when the sun
came out for a little while, quite early, it was
beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” agreed Laurie. “For myself,
I never cared much for fog-horns, but maybe the
kind they have here are different. I’m awfully
glad you slept so well, though, and—and like it.”</p>

<p>“Like it! Oh, Mr. Laurie, I can never, never
thank you enough for finding this beautiful home
for me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that wasn’t anything,” muttered Laurie.</p>

<p>“Why, Laurie Turner,” exclaimed Polly, “it
was wonderful! The rest of us might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
passed this boat a thousand times and never
thought of making it into a—an apartment!”</p>

<p>“Please, Polly dear,” Miss Comfort protested,
“not an apartment! I want it just what it is, a
boat—my boat. You don’t think, do you”—she
appealed to Laurie—“that it would do to change
the name? Of course the <i>Pequot Queen</i> is very
pretty, but I would so like to call it after grandfather’s
ship there.” Her gaze went to the oil-painting
on the wall.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why not,” said Laurie. “All we’d
have to do would be to paint out the old name.
What was your grandfather’s ship called,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Lydia W. Frye</i>,” replied Miss Comfort
raptly. “He named her after my grandmother.
She was one of the New Jersey Fryes.”</p>

<p>Laurie had a slight fit of coughing, which he
recovered from so abruptly, when he encountered
Ned’s scowl, that he nearly choked. “A nice
name,” declared Ned sternly. “I’m sure we
could change the letters on the bow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now I don’t believe I’d want you to go
to all that trouble,” said Miss Comfort. “I’ll
just call it the <i>Lydia W. Frye</i> to myself, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
will do quite well. Now I’m going to give you
some tea.”</p>

<p>There were some cookies and sweet crackers
with it, and for these the hostess apologized. She
hadn’t had time to do any baking yet, she explained,
and Brose had got these at the store for
her last evening. To-morrow, however, she was
going to get to work, for she had several orders
that just had to be filled at once. It was after
the first cup of tea—and it did seem that Miss
Comfort’s tea was very, very different from any
other tea, tasting, as Ned put it, like <em>tea</em> instead
of leather—that Laurie looked inquiringly at his
brother and Ned nodded and the twins arose and
stood with their backs to the door. Then Ned
bowed and announced: “Original poetical composition
by the Turner Brothers entitled—”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at Laurie. “What <em>is</em> it
entitled?” he demanded. Laurie shook his head.</p>

<p>“We forgot to entitle it.”</p>

<p>“Entitled,” continued Ned, “entitled ‘Ode.’”</p>

<p>Polly clapped delightedly, and Bob inquired
facetiously, “How much?” The twins bowed in
unison, and Ned recited the first line and Laurie
the second, after which they again alternated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O <i>Pequot Queen</i>, your stormy voyaging ’s o’er.</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">No more you’ll brave the wave’s and wind’s discomfort.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Here, nestled ’gainst a peaceful, kindly shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">You’re parlor, bedroom, bath for our Miss Comfort!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Applause was loud and prolonged. The twins
bowed repeatedly, their hands on their hearts,
their eyes languishing gratitude on the appreciative
audience.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Miss Comfort, with the tone
of one making a surprising discovery, “it was
poetry!”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Laurie defensively, “but
we warned you!”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort looked a trifle puzzled until
Polly laughingly assured her that she mustn’t
mind Laurie, that he was always saying silly
things. Whereupon the little lady said disapprovingly:
“You mustn’t say that, Polly.
I’m sure Mr. Laurie isn’t <em>silly</em>. Sometimes I
don’t quite understand him, my dear, but I’m
sure he isn’t <em>silly</em>!”</p>

<p>“You’re a perfect dear!” replied Polly rapturously.</p>

<p>Laurie had seized his cap and Mae’s umbrella.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
“Back in five minutes,” he said from the doorway.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Where are you going?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>“Got to see Brose Wilkins a minute about—about
something.”</p>

<p>“Well, make it peppy,” said Ned. “We’re
not going to wait for you long, old son.”</p>

<p>Laurie’s five minutes was more like fifteen, but
he returned at last and they said good-by and
were almost on their way when Miss Comfort
sent Laurie’s heart down toward his shoes.
“Mr. Laurie,” she asked apologetically, “I wonder
if you’d mind stopping in to see me for a
minute to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, no, ma’am,” stammered Laurie.
“I’d be pleased to.” He exchanged meaning
glances with Polly. Then Polly asked: “Why
don’t you stay now, Laurie, if Miss Comfort
would like you to? We’ll leave one of the umbrellas.”</p>

<p>Laurie viewed her in strong disapproval but
accepted the situation. “I don’t need any umbrella,
though,” he said sadly. “I’ve got my
coat, and it isn’t raining so hard now.” He and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Miss Comfort watched the others depart, and
then she motioned to a chair.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down, please?” she asked.
Laurie sat down, but on the extreme edge of the
chair as though to lessen the space between him
and the door. “You see,” Miss Comfort went on
after a pause, “I’ve wanted to ask you ever since
Wednesday how you were doing all this, but I
didn’t like to when the others were around. Now
I do wish you’d tell me, please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.” Laurie gulped. “What—was
it you wanted to know, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Why, who has—has met the expense of all
the changes and improvements you have made
here, Mr. Laurie.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Laurie. “Oh! Well, you see,
Miss Comfort, we haven’t done so much after all.
Now, you take that hanging lamp. Mrs. Deane
had that and wasn’t using it—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know about the lamp,” interrupted
Miss Comfort gently, “but there’s that sink and
the awning and—and so many, many things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” Laurie glanced longingly at the
doorway. “Well, now, you’d be surprised how
little things like that cost. You take that stove-piping,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Miss Comfort. Maybe you thought that
was new pipe, but it wasn’t. It was second-hand.
We just shined it up, you see!” Laurie
waved an all-encompassing hand. “Same way
with the other things—more or less.”</p>

<p>“That sink isn’t second hand, is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, no, ma’am, not the sink.” Laurie
smiled engagingly. “But sinks aren’t expensive.
I was surprised, honest, I was, ma’am,
when we got the price on that! Why, seems like
things don’t cost half what they did a couple of
years ago!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurie,” said Miss Comfort firmly, sitting
very straight in her chair and looking at him
earnestly, “you shouldn’t try to deceive me. I
know that you and the others have spent a great
deal of money, and I’d feel horribly if I thought
it was all yours. Now, please tell me.”</p>

<p>“Well—well, it’s like this. We did put in a
few dollars, Miss Comfort, but not enough to mention,
and we were so glad to do it that you
oughtn’t to care a mite. Then—then two or
three other folks, grown-ups, you understand,
wanted to help out, and there was quite a good
deal to be done, and so we took the money and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
promised not to tell who’d given it. You see,
Miss Comfort, they wanted to see you comfortable
here. And they were folks who could afford
to do it, you know. And so—well, that’s how it
was,” Laurie concluded, observing Miss Comfort
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Thank you for telling me,” she said. “If you
promised not to divulge the names of the people
who were so kind, I shan’t expect you to. After
all—” But she stopped and was silent a moment.
Then, “I’ve always said that I would
never accept charity,” she went on musingly,
“but—well, I don’t know. Maybe I haven’t any
right to be proud. Then, somehow, this doesn’t
seem so—so degrading. It seems more like—well,
just kindness, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” agreed Laurie emphatically.
“And that’s just what it is, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel about it as I would have a few
years ago, anyhow,” said Miss Comfort thoughtfully.
Then she smiled. “Thanks for telling
me, Laurie. You don’t mind my calling you just
that, do you? You’ve been so—so— <em>Won’t</em> you
have some more cookies?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, thank you.” Laurie felt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
after going through the last few minutes he deserved
a whole plate of cookies, but he resisted
the temptation. Too many cookies weren’t
good for a fellow who hoped—sometimes—to be
a catcher!</p>

<p>He was so relieved at the outcome of the talk
that he didn’t realize it was pouring harder than
it had poured all day until he had turned into
Ash Street. When he did, he gave up the idea
of joining the others at the Widow’s and headed
as straight as Orstead’s wandering streets would
let him head for East Hall, arriving there extremely
wet despite his oilskin coat. Sounds told
him that many of the fellows had already returned,
and at the head of the first flight he encountered
Elk Thurston and his room-mate, Jim
Hallock, coming down. Hallock said, “Hello,
Nod,” and then Elk asked: “How’s the great
pitcher coming on? Going to spring him on us
pretty soon?”</p>

<p>Laurie said, “Not for another week or so,
Elk,” and heard Elk laughing as he and Jim
went down.</p>

<p>A little later, when Ned and Kewpie arrived
in No. 16, Laurie held their undivided attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>Monday morning and recitations once more.
Monday afternoon and baseball practice again.
Things went well on the field, for the candidates
for the team had returned with renewed ambitions.
Besides, there was a game with Benson
High School two days later, and that was something
to work for. Laurie managed to hit the
ball on the nose every time he stood at the batting-net,
and later on, in the five-inning practice
game, he caught for an inning and, so far as he
could discern, didn’t do so badly.</p>

<p>Back in No. 16 at half-past five, he found
Kewpie awaiting him, Kewpie looking disheveled,
weary, but triumphant. “I’ve got it!” he announced
excitedly before Laurie was well through
the door. “I’ve got the hang of it at last! That
guy’s a corker, Nod, and he says I’ll know as
much about it as he does in another month!”</p>

<p>“Restrain your enthusiasm, Kewpie,” urged
Laurie. “No use telling the whole dormitory
about it. These walls aren’t awfully thick, and
I can hear Elk tramping around up-stairs like a
hippopotamus right now.” But Laurie looked
very much pleased and settled himself to hear
Kewpie’s gladsome tidings. And when Ned came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
in a little later he heard them all over again, and
after Kewpie had reluctantly torn himself away
the twins agreed that, even allowing for a slight
exaggeration of the facts as set forth by their
late visitor, stock in the Association for the Reclamation
of Kewpie Proudtree had advanced many
points. The next afternoon the lady members of
that association were also taken into the secret,
and there was much rejoicing.</p>

<p>Polly and Mae learned the news at Bob’s tennis
tea, for that long heralded affair was at last taking
place. The court was finished and marked,
the new creamy-white net was up, and, near at
hand, a wicker table bore the paraphernalia of
afternoon tea. Practice kept Laurie away until
well after five, and Kewpie was missing for a
time, too, but Ned and George Watson and Hop
Kendrick and Hal Pringle and half a dozen other
boys were there from the start. The gentler sex
was represented by Polly, Mae, and Bob’s aunt,
the latter presiding at the tea-table. Bob beat
George Watson, 6 to 4, in an exhibition set, and
then Mae and Hal Pringle played Polly and Hop
Kendrick. After that there was tea and sandwiches
and cake, and then Bob took on Hal and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Lee, and the set went to 9 to 7 before Bob finally
broke through on Hop’s service and won. The
court was all that Bob’s fondest hope had pictured.
Mr. Starling arrived before the party
broke up and went through three games with Mae
to the delight of the audience, by that time swelled
with the arrival of Kewpie and Laurie.</p>

<p>Benson won from Hillman’s the next afternoon,
13 to 7. The home team played rather ragged
ball in the field, although the pitching of George
Pemberton and Nate Beedle was satisfactory
enough. Nate relieved Pemberton in the fifth inning,
too late to prevent three runs that put the
visitors well in the lead. Laurie saw the game
from the bench, for Cas Bennett wore the mask
from start to finish.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon Hillman’s met Tudor
Hall School and played a much steadier game.
The Blue dislodged the opposing pitcher in the
third inning and put the game safely away with
six runs. Later four more were added, and the
total of ten was more than enough to win, even
though Tudor Hall staged a rally in the first of
the ninth and hit Croft, who had succeeded Pemberton
in the seventh, to all corners of the field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
and got three runners across the plate before
Pat Browne, in right field, pulled down a fly
and ended the fracas. Again Laurie was a non-combatant,
although Elk Thurston caught during
the final two innings and behaved rather well
during that hectic ninth.</p>

<p>The following afternoon Ned, as self-appointed
secretary and treasurer, rendered an accounting
of the <i>Pequot Queen</i> fund, showing a balance in
the treasury of $1.42. All bills had been paid,
and the question of disposing of the balance came
before the meeting. Kewpie’s suggestion was
typical.</p>

<p>“Pay it to Miss Comfort,” he said, “and we’ll
trade it out in cake!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t ours,” Ned reminded him sternly.
“Besides it’s not for you to be thinking of cake,
old dear.”</p>

<p>It was Polly’s suggestion that was finally
adopted. They would give the vast sum to Brose
Wilkins to be used for the purchase of flower-seeds
for the boxes and beds. That momentous
question settled, they set forth to call at the
<i>Pequot Queen</i>, or, as Laurie reminded them they
should now call the boat, the <i>Lydia W. Frye</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>April became May, and the Hillman’s School
nine went on playing Wednesday and Saturday
games, losing not quite as often as it won. Laurie
twice donned the mask in contests and did as
well, perhaps a bit better, than he had expected
to. He did very well at receiving the ball from
the pitcher, and he was remarkably steady at all
times, but he was weak when it came to holding
the runners on bases, his heaves to second being
erratic, to say the least. At bat, however, he was
improving fast, and when May was a fortnight
old there was not much to choose between him and
Elk Thurston as a catcher, although possibly the
latter’s greater age and size inspired more confidence.
Perhaps Coach Mulford thought so, for
Elk was given more chances than Laurie behind
the bat.</p>

<p>When Hillman’s went to play Benson, most of
the school accompanied the team. Polly and Mae
went, too, escorted by Ned and George Watson.
Hillman’s won, but not until the tenth inning, and
then by 3 to 2. Nate Beedle pitched fine ball that
day. Hillman’s returned to Orstead tired but
happy.</p>

<p>Just a week later Polly celebrated her sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
birthday with a party attended by Mae, Ned, Bob,
Kewpie, and, since the affair was held in the forenoon,
Laurie. And, of course, Mrs. Deane was
present. Miss Comfort had been invited and in
lieu of her presence had provided a gorgeous
birthday cake. Antoinette, wearing a new pink
ribbon that exactly matched her pink nose and
ears, and Towser, the cat, may also said to have
attended. Polly received many presents and was
very bright of eye and very happy.</p>

<p>The celebration continued in the afternoon
when the entire party attended the game with
Cole’s School, although, Laurie, of course, did
not sit with the others in the stand but watched
the nine tragic innings from the bench. Nate
Beedle had a bad day; Croft, who succeeded him,
was far worse; and Pemberton alone of the pitching
staff showed any class. Pemberton got
through the final two innings without allowing a
hit, but the damage was already done. Cole’s
won by the scandalous score of 16 to 3! Polly
remarked, a trifle unreasonably, that she thought,
since it was her birthday, Hillman’s might have
won!</p>

<p>Rain caused the cancellation of the game with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
Highland the next Wednesday, and Laurie accompanied
Kewpie on his mysterious pilgrimage
to the home of Brose Wilkins. Those pilgrimages
had been made daily, excepting Sunday
for about a month now, and never once,
rain or shine, had Kewpie sought to avoid them.
Whatever it was that kept the two boys on the
dilapidated Wilkins premises for more than an
hour this Wednesday afternoon, it must have
been something important, for the rain never
ceased for a moment during that time, and, knowing
Kewpie as we do, it seems fair to assume
that only an important mission could have kept
him from the snug window-seat of No. 15 East
Hall on such a day.</p>

<p>Returning, their way took them within a few
yards of the <i>Pequot Queen</i>. The river beyond
looked gray and sullen; the rain was falling steadily
and remorselessly; the new paint of the transformed
ferry boat gleamed with moisture. But
from the smoke-pipe in the roof a cheerful trail of
gray ascended, and at the windows the blue and
white curtains shone cozily. Once they saw the
small, erect form of Miss Comfort, white-aproned,
pass a casement and, or so Kewpie solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
averred, heard the sound of a faintly sung song.
There was such an atmosphere of warmth and
hominess and cheer about the quaint abode that
Kewpie lagged noticeably and would have welcomed
a suggestion from his companion that
they stop a moment and say “Hello” to the
occupant. But it was close to supper-time and
Laurie went sternly on, refusing to notice
Kewpie’s deep sigh.</p>

<p>They reached the entrance of the dormitory
just as Ned got there. Ned carried his golf-bag
and was very wet indeed. Laurie viewed him
commiseratingly. “You poor forlorn fish,” he
said. “Don’t tell me you’ve been playing golf
a day like this!”</p>

<p>“Sure have,” answered Ned cheerfully.
“Won, too. Had Peyton three up on the seventh,
too, old son.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly are a nut! Didn’t either
of you know it was raining?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?” countered Ned. “Look at
your own shoes!”</p>

<p>“We,” replied Laurie with dignity, “were
engaged in a sensible and important occupation,
not merely amusing ourselves!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>“Were, eh?” Ned grinned. “What important
part did you play in it?”</p>

<p>“I,” began Laurie, “contributed my—er—my—”</p>

<p>“He chased the ball,” chuckled Kewpie as he
disappeared to No. 15.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<small>THE TRY-OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">By the first of June Hillman’s baseball team
had settled into its stride. Four successive
victories had restored the confidence of
players and adherents alike, and the final test of
the season, the game with Farview Academy,
played this year at Orstead, was being viewed
in prospect with less apprehension. Laurie had
somewhat solved the science of throwing to
bases from the plate and was running a very
even race with Elk Thurston, a fact that did
nothing to increase the entente cordiale between
those two. Elk seldom missed an opportunity
to make himself disagreeable to his rival, and
since Elk was both older and bigger, and possessed
also the prestige of being a member of the
upper-middle class, Laurie had to keep his
temper many times when he didn’t want to.
After all, though, Elk’s offenses weren’t important
enough to have excused serious reprisals.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
He made fun of the younger boy and “ragged”
him when he was at work. Sometimes he got a
laugh from his audience, but more often he
didn’t, for his humor was a bit heavy. His
antagonism was largely personal, for he did not
accept Laurie seriously as a rival.</p>

<p>He liked best of all to tease the other on the
score of the latter’s failure to make good his
boast of transforming the impossible Kewpie
Proudtree into a pitcher. Elk, like about every
one else, had concluded that Laurie had given
up that task in despair. But whereas the others
had virtually forgotten the amusing episode, Elk
remembered and dwelled on it whenever opportunity
presented. That Laurie failed to react
as Elk expected him to annoyed him considerably.
Laurie always looked cheerfully untroubled by
gibes on that subject. Any one but Elk would
have recognized failure and switched to a more
certain method, but Elk was not very quick of
perception.</p>

<p>On a Saturday soon after the beginning of the
month the Blue met Loring in a game remarkable
for coincidences. Each team made eleven hits
and eleven runs in the eleven innings that were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
played—errors and brilliant plays alternating.
George Pemberton started for Hillman’s but gave
way to Nate Beedle in the second. Elk caught
the final two innings in creditable style, and
Laurie again looked on from the bench.</p>

<p>On the following Monday afternoon Laurie
laid in wait for Mr. Mulford on the gymnasium
steps. “We’re ready for that try-out whenever
you are, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Eh? What try-out is that?” asked the
coach.</p>

<p>“Proudtree’s, sir. You know you said you’d
give him one.”</p>

<p>“Proudtree? Why I understood he’d quit
long ago!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he didn’t quit. He’s been practising
at least an hour every day, except Sundays, for
more than two months.”</p>

<p>“He has? Well, well! And you think he can
pitch some, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Laurie firmly.</p>

<p>“All right. Now, let’s see. I don’t believe
I’ll have time to look at him to-day, Turner.
How about to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“Tuesday? He hasn’t anything from eleven
fifteen to twelve, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. Tell him to be over at the field at
eleven twenty. You’ll catch for him? I hope
this isn’t just a flivver, my boy, for from present
indications we’re going to need pitchers next
year.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t we be able to use another this
year, if we had him?” asked Laurie, grinning.
Mr. Mulford smiled responsively.</p>

<p>“Hm, we might, and that’s a fact,” he
acknowledged. “Well, have your champion on
hand to-morrow morning, Turner.” He hurried
on into the gymnasium, and, after a thoughtful
stare into space, Laurie followed him.</p>

<p>“Next year!” scoffed Kewpie when, after
practice, Laurie reported the gist of his talk
with the coach. “He’s crazy! What’s the
matter with this year? I’ll bet you I can pitch
as good ball as Orville Croft right now.”</p>

<p>“And that wouldn’t be saying much, either,”
assented Laurie.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve got him on the team,” grumbled
Kewpie. “Pinky’s got a nerve if he thinks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
I’m going to wait around for a whole year after
the way I’ve been working all spring!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he ain’t so well in his nerve,” mused
Laurie. “Ought to see a doctor about—”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t you tell him I wanted to play
this year?” demanded Kewpie impatiently.
Laurie shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, you see, dear old lad, I didn’t want to
overtax his brain. You know how these baseball
coaches are. They can wrestle with one
idea, but when it comes to two at the same
time—” Laurie shrugged eloquently. Kewpie
viewed him doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” he said, grinning. “Well,
anyway, he’s got to give me a chance with the
team this year. If he doesn’t he won’t get me
next.”</p>

<p>“I’ll mention that to him to-morrow,” replied
the other soberly. “I dare say if we take
a firm attitude with him he will come around.
Well, eleven twenty, then. I’ll wait for you in
front.”</p>

<p>“In front” at Hillman’s meant the steps of
School Hall or their immediate vicinity, and on
the steps the two met the next forenoon. Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
had brought his mitten, and Kewpie had his
glove and a ball in his pockets. On the way
along Summit Street to the athletic field, which
was a quarter of a mile to the south, Kewpie was
plainly nervous. He didn’t have much to say,
but at intervals he took the ball from his pocket,
curved his heavy fingers about it, frowned,
sighed and put it away again.</p>

<p>Mr. Mulford was awaiting them, and Kewpie,
for one, was glad to see that he was alone.
After greetings the boys laid aside their coats,
and Kewpie rolled his shirt-sleeves up. Mr.
Mulford seated himself on a bench near the
batting-net, crossed his knees and waited. His
attitude and general demeanor told Laurie that
he was there to fulfill a promise rather than in the
expectation of being thrilled.</p>

<p>“Start easy,” counseled Laurie. “Don’t try
to pitch until you’ve tossed a few, Kewpie.”</p>

<p>Kewpie nodded, plainly very conscious of the
silent figure on the bench. He wound up slowly,
caught sight of Laurie’s mitten held palm outward
in protest, and dropped his arms, frowning.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Mulford, “better start slow,
Proudtree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>Kewpie tossed five or six balls into Laurie’s
mitt without a wind-up and between tosses
stretched and flexed the muscles of his stout
arm.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Laurie finally. He crouched
and signaled under the mitten. Kewpie shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know your signals,” he objected.
“You tell me what you want.”</p>

<p>“Pitch some straight ones,” suggested the
coach.</p>

<p>Kewpie obliged. His stand in the box and his
wind-up were different from what they had been
when Laurie had last caught him. Considering
his build, Kewpie’s appearance and movements
were easy and smooth. He had a queer habit of
bringing the pitching hand back close to the left
thigh after the delivery, which, while novel, was
rather impressive. Kewpie’s deliveries were
straight enough to please any one, but Mr. Mulford
called:</p>

<p>“Speed them up, son. You’d never get past
the batsman with those!”</p>

<p>Kewpie shot the ball away harder. Laurie
returned it and thumped his mitt encouragingly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
“That’s the stuff, Kewpie! Steam ’em up!
Now then!”</p>

<p>Kewpie pitched again and once more. Mr.
Mulford spoke. “You haven’t any speed,
Proudtree,” he said regretfully. “The weakest
batter on the scrub could whang those out for
home runs. Got anything else?”</p>

<p>Kewpie had recovered his assurance now.
“Sure,” he answered untroubledly. “What do
you want?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mulford replied a trifle tartly. “I want
to see anything you’ve got that looks like
pitching. I certainly haven’t seen anything
yet!”</p>

<p>“Curve some,” said Laurie.</p>

<p>Kewpie fondled the ball very carefully, wound
up, and pitched. The result was a nice out-shoot
that surprised even Laurie, who nearly let it get
past him into the net. “That’s pitching,” he
called. “Let’s have another.”</p>

<p>Kewpie sent another. Mr. Mulford arose from
the bench and took up a position behind the net.
“Let’s have that out-curve again,” he commanded.
Kewpie obeyed. “All right,” said the
coach. “Not bad. Try a drop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>Kewpie’s first attempt went wrong, but the
next one sailed to the plate a little more than
knee-high and then sought to bury itself in the
dust. Laurie heard the coach grunt. A third
attempt attained a similar result. “What else
have you got?” asked Mr. Mulford. Laurie detected
a note of interest at last.</p>

<p>“Got an in-shoot,” replied Kewpie with all of
his accustomed assurance, “and a sort of floater.”</p>

<p>“Show me,” answered the coach.</p>

<p>The in-shoot was just what its name implied,
and Kewpie presented two samples of it. The
“floater,” however, was less impressive, although
Laurie thought to himself that it might
prove a hard ball to hit if offered after a curve.
Mr. Mulford grunted again. “Now pitch six
balls, Proudtree,” he said, “and mix ’em up.”</p>

<p>Kewpie pitched an out, a straight drop, an
out-drop, a straight ball, an in, and a “floater.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said Mr. Mulford to Laurie.
“Come over to the bench.” Laurie dropped the
ball in his pocket, signaled to Kewpie, and
followed the coach. Kewpie ambled up inquiringly.
“Sit down, son,” said Mr. Mulford.
Then, “Where’d you learn that stuff?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>With Laurie’s assistance, Kewpie told him.</p>

<p>“Wilkins,” mused the coach. “Must have been
the year before I took hold here. I don’t remember
any game with High School in which we got
licked that badly. He must be all he says he is,
though, if he can teach any one else to pitch that
stuff. Well, I’m not going to tell you you’re a
Christy Mathewson, Proudtree, for you’ve got a
long way to go yet before you’ll be getting any
medals. I guess I don’t have to tell you that
you aren’t built quite right for baseball, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m down to a hundred and fifty-four,”
answered Kewpie calmly, “and I’m not so slow
as I look.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean your weight,” said the coach,
suppressing a smile. “I mean your build. You’ll
have to work just about twice as hard as Beedle
would, for instance, to get the same result.
You’re—well, you’re just a little bit too close-coupled,
son!”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen fellows like me play mighty good
baseball,” said Kewpie.</p>

<p>“I dare say. If you have, you’ve seen them
work mighty hard at it! Well, I’m not trying
to discourage you. I’m only telling you this to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
impress you with the fact—and it is a fact, Proudtree—that
you’ll have to buckle down and work
mighty earnestly if you want to be a really capable
pitcher next year.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about—” Kewpie glanced fittingly
at Laurie—“what about this year, sir?”</p>

<p>Laurie saw the coach’s gaze waver. “This
year?” he echoed. “Why, I don’t know. We’re
fixed pretty well this year, you see. Of course
I’m perfectly willing to let you work with the
crowd for the rest of the season. Pitching to the
net will teach you a whole lot, for you can’t judge
your stuff until you’ve got some ambitious chap
swinging at it. Some of that stuff you’ve just
showed me would be candy for a good hitter.
You’ve got one weakness, Proudtree, and it’s an
important one. You haven’t speed, and I don’t
believe you’ll have it. That’s your build; no
fault of yours, of course.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” agreed Kewpie, “but Brose
Wilkins says I don’t need speed. He says I’ve
got enough without it. He says there are heaps
of mighty good pitchers in the Big League that
can’t pitch a real fast ball to save their lives!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but you’re not a candidate for the Big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
League yet. If you’ve ever watched school-boy
baseball, you’ve seen that what they can’t hit,
five times out of seven, is a really fast ball. They
like to say they can, and I guess they believe it,
but they can’t. Maybe one reason is that they
don’t often get fast ones, for there aren’t many
youngsters of your age who can stand the strain
of pitching them. Mind, I don’t say that you
won’t be able to get by without more speed than
you’ve got, but I do say that not having speed
is a weakness. I’m emphasizing this because I
want you to realize that you’ve got to make your
curves mighty good to make up for that shortcoming.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Kewpie almost humbly. “I
understand.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now, then, let’s see. Oh, yes, about
that ball you call a ‘floater.’ Did Wilkins teach
you that?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I—I got that out of a book. It—it
isn’t as good as it might be, I guess, but I’m
getting the hang of it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t monkey with it just now.
It’s a hard ball to pitch—hard on the muscles.
You don’t want too many things. If I were you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
son, I’d stick to the curves and drops. That
out-drop of yours isn’t so bad right now, and
I guess you can make it even better. If you have
five things to offer the batter, say, an in, an out,
a drop, a drop-curve, and a slow ball, you’ve got
plenty. If you’ve got control and can change
your pace without giving yourself away you’ve
got as much as the most successful pitcher ever
did have. It’s control, son, that counts. All the
fancy stunts ever known aren’t worth a cent unless
you can put the ball where you want it to go.
And that’s that.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Then Kewpie
said: “Mr. Mulford, if I work hard and pitch to
the net and all that couldn’t I get into a game
some time? I mean some game this spring?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know,” said the coach slowly.
“What’s the idea? Want to get your letter?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but I’d—why, I’d just like to, sir,
<em>awfully</em>.”</p>

<p>“There are only four games left before the Farview
game,” was the answer, “and I don’t want
to promise anything like that, Proudtree. But I
will agree to put you in if the chance comes. Look
here, you chaps, why don’t you work together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and get to know each other? There’s a lot in
the pitcher and catcher being used to each
other’s ways. Then, perhaps, I can give you
both a whack at a couple of innings some day.
I’d do that, I think. You look after Proudtree,
Turner. Make him work. Keep his nose to the
grindstone. Remember that there’s another
year coming, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make him work,” laughed Laurie.</p>

<p>“Then do I—do I get on the team?” asked
Kewpie anxiously.</p>

<p>“You get on the squad,” was the answer.
“Report to-morrow afternoon. There’s a game
on, and you won’t get much work, but you can
pitch to Turner a while and learn the ropes.
Let’s get back now.” Coach Mulford arose.
“Turner, I suspected that you were going to
waste my time this morning, but I was wrong.
Your dark horse looks to me well worth the
grooming!”</p>

<p>He set off across the field toward the gridiron
on a short cut to the village, and the two boys
walked back to school. For the first dozen paces
nothing was said. Then Kewpie laughed and
turned to his companion. “Told you I’d do it!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
he exclaimed triumphantly. “Told you I could
pitch ball as well as the rest of them! Didn’t I,
now?”</p>

<p>“You told me a lot of things, you poor
cheese,” answered Laurie crushingly, “but
where’d you be if Ned and I hadn’t managed
you? I’ll tell you. You’d still be lying on
your window-seat, like a fat seal, reading ‘How
to Pitch’!”</p>

<p>“Huh, is that so? I guess if it comes to that,
you fat-head, Brose Wilkins is the guy—”</p>

<p>“He sure is,” agreed Laurie, “he sure is!
And, prithee, you half-baked portion of nothing
at all, who discovered Brose? Who persuaded
him to waste his time on a big, fut lummox like
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” replied Kewpie, quite unaffected
by the insults, “neither you nor Ned nor
Brose Wilkins could have made a pitcher out of
me if I hadn’t had the—the ability!”</p>

<p>“You ain’t so well in your ability,” said
Laurie scathingly. “All you’ve got is a start,
old son, and so don’t get to thinking that you’re
a Big Leaguer! Maybe with prayer and hard
work I’ll make you amount to something by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
next year, but right now you’re nothing but a
whispered promise!”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” said Kewpie, and again, “Is
that so?” He wasn’t quick at repartee, and
just then that was the best he could do.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<small>THE DEAD LETTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Although Kewpie made no secret of his
acceptance on the baseball team, in fact
gave a certain amount of publicity to the fact,
his appearance on the diamond the next afternoon
created a distinct sensation. Aware of the
sensation, Kewpie became suddenly taciturn, and
when he did speak he clothed his words in
mystery. Laurie, seeing an opportunity to render
Kewpie’s advent more spectacular, seized it.
During Craigskill’s practice on the diamond the
Hillman’s pitchers warmed up in front of the
first base stand. Beedle and Pemberton pitched
to Cas Bennett and Elk Thurston. As Croft
was not to be used, Laurie’s services were not
required, and he sat on the bench. But when the
opportunity was glimpsed he arose, picked a ball
from the old water-bucket, drew on his mitten,
and signaled to Kewpie. Then he took his
place beyond Cas, and Kewpie ambled to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
station beside Nate Beedle, and a ripple of
incredulous delight ran the length of the bench.
Kewpie tossed a ball into Laurie’s mitten, and
the bench applauded with a note of hysteria.
Not until then did Coach Mulford, who had been
talking to the manager, become aware of the
fact that something of interest was taking place.
He looked, saw, stared. Then the ends of his
mouth went up a little, tiny puckers appeared at
the corners of his eyes, and he chuckled softly.
Around him the players and substitutes were
laughing uproariously. They had reason, it
seemed. The sight of the short and rotund
Kewpie in juxtaposition to the tall and slender
Beedle might have brought a smile to the face
of a wooden statue. But Kewpie seemed unaware
of the amusement he was causing. He
pitched his slow balls into Laurie’s mitt gravely
enough, finishing his delivery with his hand close
to his left side, as though, as one facetious observer
put it, a mosquito demanded attention.</p>

<p>Laurie laughed inwardly, but outwardly his
expression and demeanor were as sober and
as earnest as Kewpie’s. Mr. Mulford’s countenance
showed him that that gentleman appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
the humor of the incident and that
he was to be allowed to “get away with it.” Beside
him, Elk Thurston’s face was angry and
sneering.</p>

<p>“Some pitcher you’ve got,” he said, speaking
from the corner of his mouth. “You and he
make a swell battery, Turner.” Then, as he
sped the ball back to Nate, he called: “Guess it’s
all up with you, Nate. See what the cat brought
in!”</p>

<p>Nate smiled but made no answer.</p>

<p>Then Hillman’s trotted out on the diamond,
and the pitchers retired to the bench. Laurie
chose a seat well removed from Mr. Mulford, and
Kewpie sank down beside him. Kewpie was
chuckling almost soundlessly. “Did you see
Elk’s face?” he murmured. “Gee!”</p>

<p>Laurie nodded. “He’s awfully sore. He
thought we’d given up, you know, and when he
caught sight of you coming out of the gym his
eyes almost popped out of his head. There’s
Ned over there in the stand, and George and the
girls. Say, Kewpie, you’ve just got to get into
a game before the season’s over or I’ll be
eternally disgraced!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll make it,” answered Kewpie comfortably.
“You heard what he said.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he didn’t make any promise.
That’s what’s worrying me. Wonder how it
would be to drop poison in Nate’s milk some day.
Or invite him to ride in Mr. Wells’s roadster
and run him into a telegraph-pole!” It was the
sight of Mr. Wells coming around the corner of
the stand that had put the latter plan into his
head. “Got to manage it somehow,” he ended.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Kewpie. “Don’t you
worry about it. He’ll give me a chance soon.
He didn’t say much yesterday, Nod, but I could
see that he was impressed.”</p>

<p>“You could, eh?” Laurie viewed the other
admiringly. “Say, you just hate yourself, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Craigskill Military College took a three-run
lead in the first inning and maintained it throughout
the remaining eight innings. The game was
mainly a pitchers’ battle, with the enemy twirler
having rather the better of the argument, and,
from the point of view of the onlooker, was
decidedly slow and uninteresting. Kewpie’s
presence on the bench supplied a welcome diversion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
at such times as Hillman’s was at bat.
Almost every one liked Kewpie, and his performance
as center of the football team had commanded
respect, but he came in for a whole lot
of good-natured raillery that afternoon. So, too,
did Laurie. And neither of them minded it.
Elk glowered and slid in sarcastic comments
when chance afforded, but they could afford to
disregard him.</p>

<p>When the game was over the substitutes held
practice, and the few spectators who remained
were rewarded for their loyalty if only by the
spectacle of Kewpie Proudtree sliding to first
during base-running practice! Kewpie at bat was
another interesting spectacle, for there was a
very great deal he didn’t know about batting
despite having played scrub ball to some
extent. But Kewpie believed firmly in Kewpie,
laughed with the others at his own expense, and
stored up knowledge. He was, however, heartily
glad when the brief session came to an end, for
some of the requirements had been extremely
novel to him.</p>

<p>Saturday’s game, played down the river at
Melrose Ferry, resulted in a ten-inning victory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
for Hillman’s. To his surprise and chagrin,
Kewpie was not taken with the team, but he went
along nevertheless and viewed the contest with
ironical gaze from a seat in the stand. It is
probable that he felt no consuming grief when,
in the fifth inning, Nate Beedle was forced to
give way to Pemberton. It is equally likely that
he would have managed to dissemble his sorrow
had Pemberton been knocked out of the box and
a despairing coach had called loudly for “Proudtree!
Find Proudtree! We must have him!
He alone can avert defeat!” Nothing of that
sort happened, though. George Pemberton finished
the game nicely, even bringing in one of
Hillman’s four runs with a safe hit to the left in
the eighth. It remained to Captain Dave himself,
however to secure the victory in the tenth inning
with a home run. Returning to Orstead, Kewpie
attached himself to Laurie and was very critical
of the team’s performance. Laurie, who had
pinch-hit for Murdock in the eighth and had
popped up a weak in-field fly, was gloomy enough
to relish the conversation until Kewpie became
too caustic. Then Laurie sat on him cruelly and
informed him that instead of “panning” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
team he had better be thinking up some way of
persuading Pinky to let him pitch a couple of
innings in one or other of the two games that
remained before the Farview contest. Thereupon
Kewpie subsided and gazed glumly from
the car window. His chance of pitching for the
team that season didn’t appear so bright to him
to-day.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon they took their accustomed
walk, Polly, Mae, Ned, Laurie, and Bob, and as
usual they stopped for a while at the <i>Pequot
Queen</i>. The afternoon was fair and warm, and
the <i>Pequot Queen</i>—or the <i>Lydia W. Frye</i>, if you
prefer—made a very attractive picture. The
new white paint and the golden yellow trim were
still fresh, the gay red and white awning
stretched above the upper deck, the flower-boxes
were green and promising—there was even one
pink geranium bloom in sight—and the beds
that Brose Wilkins had made at each side of the
gangway were filled with plants. Miss Comfort
wore an almost frivolous dress of blue with white
figures and her best cameo pin, the one nearly
as large as a butter-chip, that showed a cheerful
design of weeping willow-tree and a tombstone.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
A yellow and white cat sat sunning itself on the
railing and submitted indifferently to the caresses
of the visitors. The cat was a gift from Brose,
and Miss Comfort who had lived some sixty-odd
years without such a thing, had not had sufficient
courage to decline it. She had however, much
to her surprise, grown very much attached to the
animal as she frequently stated. She had named
it Hector.</p>

<p>To-day Miss Comfort had news for them. The
letter she had written to her brother-in-law in
Sioux City had returned. She handed it around
the circle. It had been opened, and its envelope
bore an amazing number of inscriptions, many
undecipherable, the gist of them being that Mr.
A. G. Goupil had not been found. The missive
had now been sent back by the Dead Letter
Office in Washington. It was, Miss Comfort
declared, very perplexing. Of course, she had
always written to her sister at her home address
but the firm name was just as she had told it.</p>

<p>“He might have moved away,” suggested Bob,
“after your sister died.”</p>

<p>Miss Comfort agreed that that was possible,
but Laurie said that in that case he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
certainly have left an address behind him, adding,
“Well, if he didn’t get that letter he
probably didn’t get our telegram, either!”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s so,” said Polly. “But wouldn’t
they send that back, too, if it wasn’t delivered?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so. I’ll ask about it to-morrow at
the office. Maybe you should have put the
street and number on your letter, Miss Comfort.”</p>

<p>“Why, I never knew it. That’s the address
my sister sent me. I supposed it was all that
was necessary.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be enough,” said Bob. “How
big’s this Sioux City place, anyway? Seems to
me they ought to have been able to find the
Goupil Machinery Company, even if they didn’t
have the street address.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Comfort, “I’m relieved to
get it back. I thought it was strange that Mr.
Goupil didn’t take any notice of it. Now I
know it was because he never received it. You
see.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what we might do,” offered Laurie.
“We might find out Mr. Goupil’s address from the
lawyers who wrote you about it and then you
could write to him again, ma’am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>“Oh I shouldn’t care to do that,” replied
Miss Comfort. “I’m settled so nicely here now,
you see, Laurie. In a great many ways it is
better for me than my other home was. There
were so many rooms there to keep clean, and
then, in winter, there were the sidewalks to be
looked after, and the pipes would freeze now and
then. No, I think everything has turned out
quite for the best, just as it generally does, my
dears.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” quoth Laurie as they returned
up the hill past the telegraph office, “I’m
going in there to-morrow and find out what
happened to that message we sent.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Bob. “They ought
to give us our money back, anyway!”</p>

<p>They learned the fate of the message without
difficulty the following morning, although they
had to make two calls at the office. On the second
occasion the manager displayed a telegram from
Sioux City. Laurie’s message had been delivered
to A. T. Gompers, Globe Farm Machinery
Company, Sioux City. The date and even the
time of day were supplied. At first the manager
appeared to consider Laurie and Ned over-particular,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
but finally acknowledged that perhaps
a mistake had been made. If, he said, the sender
cared to put in a claim the company would take
up the matter and make a thorough investigation,
and if it found there really had been an
error in delivery the price of the telegram would
be refunded. But Laurie shook his head.</p>

<p>“We’re a short-lived family,” he explained.
“Few of us Turners live to be over eighty, and
so I guess there wouldn’t be time. Thank you
just as much.”</p>

<p>“What it amounts to,” said Ned, as they
hurried back to a recitation, “is that Miss
Comfort got the fellow’s name wrong somehow.
Or maybe his initials. Or maybe the name of his
company.”</p>

<p>“Or maybe there ain’t no such animal,” said
Laurie. “I always did sort of doubt that any
one could have a name like Goupil. It—it isn’t
natural, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, as Bob says, ‘All’s swell that ends
swell,’ and Miss Comfort’s satisfied with the way
it’s turned out, and so we might as well be.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Laurie. “We don’t own it.”</p>

<p>In front of the school entrance Mr. Wells’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
blue roadster was standing, a bit faded as to
paint, a bit battered as to mud-guards, but having
the self-assurance and poise of a car that has
traveled far and seen life. Laurie, to whom
automobiles were ever a passion, stopped and
looked it over. <a href="#i_fp288">“Nice old bus,” he observed,</a>
laying a friendly hand on the nickeled top of the
brake-lever. <a href="#i_fp288">“Let’s take a spin, Ned.”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp288">
  <img src="images/i_fp288.jpg" alt="" title="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="noic"><a href="#Page_287">“Nice old bus,” Laurie observed, “let’s take a spin, Ned”</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>Ned laughed. “Think you could drive it?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Why not? I don’t believe it’s locked. Kick
on the switch, push down on the starter, put her
into first—I wonder if the clutch works the same
way as dad’s car. Yes, forward, back and
across—All right, let’s go!”</p>

<p>Ned pulled him toward the gate. “You’d
better come along. First thing you know you’ll
be yielding to temptation, old son.”</p>

<p>“I sure would like to try the old boat out,”
acknowledged Laurie. “Some time he’s going
to look for it and find it missing. He’s always
leaving it around like that, putting temptation
in my way!”</p>

<p>Examinations began two days later, and
Laurie had other things to worry about than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
blue roadsters or even Kewpie’s non-participation
in baseball games, for, just between you and
me, Laurie and mathematics were not on very
friendly terms, and there was at least one other
course that caused him uneasiness. Yet, should I
fail to mention it later, he did scrape past, as
did Ned and, I think, all others in whom we are
interested. But he wasn’t certain of his fate
until a week later, which accounts in part for the
somewhat perturbed and unsettled condition of
mind that was his during the rest of the present
week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Hillman’s scored another victory,
and Laurie aided. Mr. Mulford put him to
catch at the beginning of the sixth inning, and he
performed very creditably during the remaining
four. He made one “rotten error”—I am
repeating his own words—when, in the eighth
he pegged the ball a yard over Lew Cooper’s
yearning glove and so allowed a steal to second
that, a few minutes later, became a tally. But
otherwise he did very well behind the bat and
made one hit in two times up. George Pemberton
pitched the game through, and Kewpie remained
lugubriously on the bench. Afterward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
he had quite a good deal to say about Mr.
Mulford, none of which was very flattering.
Hillman’s had put the game on ice in the fifth
inning, Kewpie averred feelingly, and it wouldn’t
have hurt Pinky or the team’s chances to have
let him pitch a couple of innings!</p>

<p>“And there’s only Saturday’s game left,”
mourned Kewpie, “and that’s with Crumbie,
and she’s better than we are and there isn’t one
chance in a hundred of my getting into it! Gee,
I should think folks wouldn’t make promises if
they don’t mean to keep ’em!”</p>

<p>Laurie, who was half of Kewpie’s audience,
Hal Pringle being the other half, reminded the
speaker that Pinky hadn’t really promised, but
his tone lacked conviction. He, too, thought
that the coach might have used Kewpie that
afternoon. Kewpie was still plaintive when
Laurie remembered that the morrow held two
examinations and hurried off for a brief period of
study before supper.</p>

<p>I have already intimated that Laurie was not
quite his usual care-free self that week, and the
same is true to a greater or lesser degree of most
of the other ninety-odd students. Finals are likely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
to put a fellow under something of a strain, and,
as a result, normal characteristics are likely to
suffer a change. The sober-minded become subject
to spells of unwonted hilarity, the normally
irrepressible are plunged in deepest gloom, and
the good-natured develop unsuspected tempers.
All this is offered as plausible partial excuse for
what happened on Friday.</p>

<small>THE FORM AT THE WINDOW</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ned had been through a hard session that
had not ended for him until after four
o’clock, and he was very far from certain that
his answers to Questions V and VIII were going
to please Mr. Pennington. A game of golf with
Dan Whipple arranged for four o’clock had not
materialized, and Ned had returned to No. 16 to
spend the remainder of the afternoon worrying
about the Latin examination. About 5:30 Laurie
came in. Laurie had a bright-red flush under
his left eye and looked extremely angry.</p>

<p>“What did you do to your face?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>Laurie viewed himself in the mirror above his
chiffonier before replying. Then, “I didn’t do
anything to it,” he answered a bit sulkily.
“That’s what Elk Thurston did.”</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” exclaimed Ned.
“Don’t tell me you’ve gone and had a fight!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not going to,” responded Laurie briefly,
sinking into a chair.</p>

<p>“Well, then what—”</p>

<p>“Shut up and I’ll tell you,” said Laurie
crossly. “We were playing the scrubs, and Simpson
had an exam and wasn’t there, and Pinky
put me to catching for them. Elk came sprinting
in from third on a little in-field hit, and I got
the ball and blocked him easy. He was out a
yard from the plate, and that made him mad; that
and the fact that he’d made an ass of himself by
trying to score, with only one out, on a hit to
short-stop. So he jumped up and made a great
howl about my having spiked him. Of course I
hadn’t. All I had done was block him off when
he tried to slide. Cooper told him to shut up,
and he went off growling.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did you get—”</p>

<p>“I’m telling you, if you’ll let me! After
practice I was walking back with Kewpie and
Pat Browne, and just before we got to the fence
across the road down there Elk came up and
grabbed me by the arm and pulled me around.
That made me mad, anyhow, and then he began
calling me names and saying what he’d do if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
wasn’t too little, and I swung for him. Missed
him, dog-gone it! Then he handed me this and I
got him on the neck and the others butted in.
That’s all there was to it. How’s the silly
thing look?”</p>

<p>“It looks punk,” answered Ned unsympathetically.
“Better go down and bathe it in hot
water and then put some talcum on it. Gosh,
son, I should think you’d have more sense than
to get in a brawl with Elk Thurston. That
rough-neck stuff doesn’t get you anywhere
and—”</p>

<p>“For the love of limes, shut up!” exclaimed
Laurie. “I didn’t start it!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t? Didn’t you just say that you
hit him first—or tried to?”</p>

<p>“What of it? Wouldn’t you have struck him
if he’d called you all sorts of names, like that?
I’ll say you would! You’re always strong on
the ‘calm yourself’ stuff, but I notice that when
any one gets fresh with you—”</p>

<p>“I don’t pick quarrels and slug fellows right
under the eyes of faculty, you idiot! For that
matter—”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it!” growled Laurie. “What difference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
does it make <em>where</em> you do it? You give
me a pain!”</p>

<p>“You give me worse than that,” replied Ned
angrily. “You look like—like a prize-fighter with
that lump on your cheek. It’s a blamed shame
he didn’t finish the job, I say!”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Maybe you’d like to finish it
for him, eh? If you think you would, just say
so!”</p>

<p>Ned shrugged contemptuously. “Guess you’ve
had enough for one day,” he sneered. “Take my
advice and—”</p>

<p>“Your advice!” cried Laurie shrilly. “Your
advice! Yes, I’m likely to, you poor shrimp!”
He jumped to his feet and glared at Ned invitingly.
“You make me sick, Ned, you and your
advice. Get it? You haven’t got enough spunk
to resent a whack on the nose!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t shout like a cheap skate,” answered
Ned disgustedly. “Go and fix yourself up, if you
can, so I won’t be ashamed to go to supper with
you!”</p>

<p>Laurie glared, swallowed hard, and finally
nodded. “Listen,” he said slowly. “You don’t
have to be seen with me if it offends your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
delicate sensibilities. Get it? And, what’s
more, I don’t want to be seen with you. I’m
particular, too, you big bluff. When you want to
go to supper, you go!”</p>

<p>Laurie grabbed wash-cloth and towel, strode
across the room, and slammed the door resoundingly
behind him. Left alone, Ned shrugged
angrily. “Ugly-tempered brute,” he muttered.</p>

<p>When supper-time came he descended alone to
the dining-hall. Laurie had not returned to the
room. Laurie arrived a few minutes late, with
Kewpie, and took the seat at Ned’s left in silence.
He had put talc powder over the abrasion on his
cheek-bone, and at a little distance it would not
have been noticed. Nearer, however, the lump
was plainly visible and seemed to be still swelling.
Ned caught a glimpse of it from the corner of his
eye, but his irritation still continued, and he
offered no comment.</p>

<p>After supper both boys returned to No. 16, although
not together, and for two hours occupied
opposite sides of the table, and crammed for their
last examination, which was due at ten to-morrow.
Neither spoke once during the evening. At nine
Laurie closed his books and went out. Half an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
hour later Ned undressed and went to bed.
Sleep didn’t come readily, for there was to-day’s
examination to worry about, and to-morrow’s,
too, for he hadn’t made much of that two hours
of preparation, he feared; and then there was
this silly quarrel with Laurie. He guessed he
had been as much to blame as his brother, but
there was no sense in any one’s getting mad the
way Laurie had. When Laurie was ready to
make friends, why, he’d be ready, too, but that
silly goop needn’t expect him to lick his shoes!
No, sir, if Laurie wanted to make up he could
jolly well say so!</p>

<p>Sleep did come at last, and when he awoke it
seemed hours later. The room was in black
darkness, but the squares of the wide open
windows were slightly grayer. What had
awakened him he at first didn’t know. Then his
gaze caught a darker something against the gray-black
of the nearer casement opening, something
that scuffled on the stone ledge and grew larger
as he wondered and watched. He opened his
mouth to speak, and then remembered that he and
Laurie were at outs. The form disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
from sight, and footsteps went softly across the
boards, were muffled on the rug, and sounded
again by the door. <a href="#i_frontis">The door was opened, and</a> for
a moment Ned mentally pictured <a href="#i_frontis">the boy peering</a>
anxiously out <a href="#i_frontis">into the dim hall</a>. Then the door
closed again, and after a short silence Laurie’s
bed creaked. To prove to the other that his return
had not been made unknown, Ned sat up in
the blackness and thumped his pillow, striving
to express disapprobation in the thumps. Across
the room the faint stirrings ceased, and silence
reigned again.</p>

<p>Ned smiled grimly. Laurie had probably
thought that by being so quiet he could get in
without his brother’s knowing it, but he had
shown him! Then Ned’s satisfaction faded.
What the dickens had Laurie been doing out at
this time of night? It must be twelve, or even
later! If he had been up to mischief—but of
course he had; a fellow didn’t climb into his
room by the window unless he had something to
hide. Even being out after ten o’clock was a
punishable offense! Ned began to worry. Suppose
some one had seen Laurie. Why had Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
gone to the door and listened unless he had suspected
some one of having seen him? The idiot!
The chump! The—</p>

<p>Over his head he heard a board creak. He listened.
The sound reached him again. In Elk
Thurston’s room some one was up, too. Or had
he imagined it? All was quiet now. Was it possible
that Laurie and Elk had been settling their
score? Surely not at this time of night. And
yet— From across the room came the unmistakable
sounds of deep and regular breathing. Laurie
was asleep beyond a doubt! Ned frowned disgustedly.
Here he was worrying himself about
a silly coot that was fast asleep! He poked his
head resolutely into his pillow. All right! He
guessed he could do that, too! And presently he
did.</p>

<p>In the morning Ned waited for Laurie to break
the ice, but Laurie didn’t. Laurie went about his
task of dressing in silence. There was a sort of
stern look in his face in place of the sullen expression
of last evening, and more than once Ned
caught him looking across in an oddly speculative
way. The last time Ned caught him at it he began
to feel uneasy, and he wanted very much to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
ask what Laurie meant by it. It was almost as
if Laurie had caught <em>him</em> at something, instead
of its being just the other way about! But he
was too stubborn to speak first, and they went
out of the room with the silence still unbroken.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Mr. Brock, at whose table they
sat, made the disquieting announcement that Edward
and Laurence Turner were wanted at the
Doctor’s study at 8:30. Involuntarily the gaze
of the two boys met swiftly. Each thought at
once of examinations, although further consideration
told them that it was still too soon for
any shortcomings of theirs to reach the principal.</p>

<p>Although they had entered the dining-hall separately,
now a common uneasiness took them together
to the Doctor’s, albeit in silence. They
were asked to be seated, which they accepted as
a favorable sign, but there was, nevertheless,
something unsympathetic in Dr. Hillman’s countenance.
The latter swung himself around in his
chair and faced them, his head thrust forward
a little because of a near-sightedness not wholly
corrected by his spectacles. And then Laurie observed
that the Doctor was gazing intently at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
point just under his left eye, and told himself that
the summons was explained. He was, though,
still wondering why Ned had been included in
the party when the Doctor spoke.</p>

<p>“Laurence,” he asked, “how did you come by
that contusion?”</p>

<p>Laurie hesitated, then answered, “I was having
a—a little bout with one of the fellows and
he struck me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who was the boy?”</p>

<p>“Thurston, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you witnesses to prove that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, several fellows were there. Pat—I
mean Patton Browne, and Proudtree and—”</p>

<p>“When did it take place, this—ah—bout?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon, about half-past five.”</p>

<p>The Doctor mused a minute. Then, “Which
of you boys entered your room by the window
last night at about a quarter before twelve
o’clock?” he asked. The question was so unexpected
that Laurie’s mouth fell open widely.
Then, as neither boy answered, the Doctor continued:
“Was it you, Laurence?”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir!” blurted Laurie.</p>

<p>Then, ere the words were well out, he wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
them back, and in a sudden panic he added, “I
mean—”</p>

<p>But the Doctor had turned to Ned. “Was it
you, Edward?” he asked.</p>

<p>Ned’s gaze dropped from the Doctor’s, and
for an instant he made no reply. Then he raised
his eyes again, and, “I’d rather not say, sir,”
he announced respectfully but firmly.</p>

<p>There followed another brief silence. Laurie
was trying hard not to look at Ned. The Doctor
was thoughtfully rolling a pencil across the big
blotter under the palm of one hand. Ned watched
him and waited. Then the Doctor looked up
again.</p>

<p>“You are, of course,” he said not unkindly,
“privileged to refuse to answer, Edward, but
when you do there is but one construction to be
placed on your refusal. I presume that you did
climb into your room by a window last night. I
confess that I don’t understand it, for this is the
first time since you came to us that your conduct
has been questioned. If you are shielding another—”
his glance swept to Laurie and away
again—“you are doing wrong. Punishment that
falls on an innocent party fails of its purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
I am, therefore, going to ask you to reconsider,
Edward. It will be better for every one if you
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to my question.”</p>

<p>Ned returned the principal’s gaze straightly.
“I’d rather not, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Very well, but I warn you that your offense is
a very serious one and that it calls for a drastic
penalty. Were you alone in the—ah—escapade?”</p>

<p>Ned looked puzzled. “Sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I asked you—But you need not answer that.
I’ll put it another way. There were two of you
in the car according to an eye-witness. Who was
the other boy?”</p>

<p>“Car?” faltered Ned. “What car, sir?”</p>

<p>The Doctor frowned disapprovingly. “It is
so futile, my boy,” he said, “to act this way.”
He turned to Laurie. “What do you know about
this, Laurence? You have said that you did not
enter your room last night by the window. At
what time did you return to your room? Where
were you, for instance, at, say, a quarter to
twelve?”</p>

<p>“I was in bed, sir.”</p>

<p>“What time did you go to bed?”</p>

<p>“About ten minutes past ten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“Where was Edward then?”</p>

<p>“In bed, sir, and asleep.”</p>

<p>“What? You are telling me the truth? Did
you see him there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The Doctor frowned perplexedly. “Then you
know nothing of any one’s having entered your
room by a window close to midnight?”</p>

<p>Laurie hesitated now. Then, “I went to sleep
about ten minutes after I got in bed, sir, and so
I wouldn’t be likely—”</p>

<p>“Please answer my question,” interrupted the
Doctor coldly.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not, sir,” said Laurie.</p>

<p>“One more question, then,” announced the inquisitor
grimly. “Were you in Mr. Wells’s automobile
last evening when it collided with a hydrant
on Washington Street at approximately
half-past eleven?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, sir! I didn’t know it had—had collided!”</p>

<p>Ned was looking rather white.</p>

<p>“You know nothing about the incident?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!”</p>

<p>“And you, Edward?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“But, if you deny the automobile part of it,
why not deny the rest? I see, though. You knew
that Mr. Cornish had seen you climbing in at the
window. I’m afraid you won’t get anywhere
that way, Edward. Mr. Wells’s car was taken
from the front of the school last evening and
driven out Washington Street six blocks, where
it was in collision with a hydrant. It was abandoned
there. A reliable witness states positively
that there were two persons in the car just before
the accident. About ten or twelve minutes
later Mr. Cornish saw some one climb up the
Washington Street side of East Hall and disappear
through your window. Those are the facts,
Edward. The evidence against you is so far
circumstantial, but you must acknowledge that
the incident of the car and that of your—of
some one’s entrance into your room by the window
look to be more than a mere coincidence.
In other words, whoever entered your room at
midnight was in the stolen car a quarter of an
hour before. That’s a fair and very natural assumption.
If I were you, I’d think the matter
over carefully and see me again before eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
o’clock this evening, at which time it will come
before the faculty conference. And now, Laurence,
let me have those names once more.” He
drew a scratch-pad to him and poised a pencil.
“You say Elkins Thurston struck you and that
Proudtree, Browne, and—who else was there?”</p>

<p>“Lew Cooper and Gordon Simkins were there
when—right afterward, sir, and I guess they saw
it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That is all, then. I shall have
to ask both of you to remain in bounds until
this matter is—ah—settled. Good morning.”</p>

<p>“But—but, Doctor, I’m—I’m on the baseball
team, sir!” exclaimed Laurie in almost horrified
accents. “We play this afternoon!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Laurence,” was the reply, “but
until you are more frank in your answers I shall
have to consider you under suspicion, also.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Laurie bitterly, when they were
outside, “you certainly have made a mess of
things!”</p>

<p>“I!” exclaimed Ned incredulously, “<em>I’ve</em>
made a mess of things? What about you?”</p>

<p>“Me? What could I say?” countered Laurie
hotly. “I did all I could!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Ned wearily. “Let’s drop
it. He won’t be able to pin anything on you.
You’ll get out of it all right.”</p>

<p>There was a trace of bitterness in Ned’s voice,
and Laurie scowled. “Well, he asked me so suddenly,”
he muttered apologetically, “I—I just
said what came into my head. I’m sorry. I’d
have refused to answer if he hadn’t sprung it so
quick.”</p>

<p>“It would have been rather more—rather less
contemptible,” answered Ned coldly.</p>

<p>Laurie flushed. “Thanks! I guess that’ll be
about all from you, Ned. When I want any more
of your brotherly remarks I’ll let you know!”
He swung aside and left Ned to go on alone to No.
16.</p>

<p>The story of the purloining of the physical director’s
blue roadster was all over school by that
time. Ned got the full details from Kewpie.
Mr. Wells had left the car in front of School
Hall, as he very often did, and was playing a
game of chess with Mr. Pennington. Shortly after
half-past eleven he had looked for the car,
had failed to find it, and had hurried to the corner.
There he had met a man coming down Walnut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
Street who, when questioned, said that he had
seen such a car as Mr. Wells’s about five blocks
east, where Washington and Walnut Streets
come together, not longer ago than five minutes.
There were two persons in it, and the car was
not being driven more than, possibly, twenty
miles an hour. Mr. Wells had gone out Walnut
Street and found the car with one front wheel
on the sidewalk, the mud-guard on that side torn
off, and the radiator stove in. There was no
one about. The car wasn’t very badly damaged,
it was said, but Mr. Wells was awfully mad about
it. It was down in Plummer’s Garage, and Ned
could see it if he wanted to. Kewpie had seen
it. It looked fierce, but maybe it wouldn’t cost
more than a hundred dollars to fix it up again!</p>

<p>“Know who did it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Me? I’ll say I don’t!” Kewpie laughed relievedly.
“I guess it was professional automobile
thieves, all right, though. They were probably
heading for Windsor. That’s a dark
corner up there, and I guess they lost the road
and turned too quick. They must have lost their
nerve, for Mr. Wells drove the car down to the
garage and it went all right, they say. Guess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
they thought it was done for and didn’t try to
see if it would still go. Sort of a joke on them,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Ned carelessly, “none of
our fellows are suspected?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Why, it happened after half-past
eleven! Say, you haven’t—haven’t heard
anything?” Kewpie’s eyes grew round with excitement.
“Say, Ned, what is it?” But Ned
shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>“I know no more of the business than you do,
Kewpie. Now beat it, will you? I’ve got an
exam at ten.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<small>SUSPENDED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ned didn’t get much studying done, though.
Instead, he spent most of the half-hour remaining
before the examination in trying to solve
the mystery of the stolen car and Laurie’s part in
the affair. It wasn’t like Laurie to indulge in
a prank so mischievous, and he could scarcely believe
that Laurie had taken part in the escapade.
Still, he had the evidence of his own senses. He
had seen Laurie enter by the window; and, too,
he recalled the latter’s stated desire to drive Mr.
Wells’s car. At home in California Laurie was
forever begging the wheel away from his father
and was never happier than when steering the
big car along the smooth roads about Santa Lucia.
But, if Laurie had taken Mr. Wells’s roadster,
who had been with him? He wished that
Laurie hadn’t told a lie to the Doctor. That,
too, was something very unlike Laurie. Of
course, as he had said afterward, the question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
had been sudden and unexpected, and he had said
the first thing that came into his mind, but that
didn’t excuse the lie.</p>

<p>Ned’s refusal to answer had been made in the
effort to shift suspicion from Laurie to himself,
but he wondered now if it would not have been
as well to tell the truth. His self-sacrifice hadn’t
helped his brother much, after all, for Laurie
was still suspected of complicity. The affair
would probably end in the suspension of them
both, perhaps in their expulsion. It was all a
sorry mess, and Ned hadn’t discovered any solution
of it when ten o’clock came.</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise, he got through the examination,
which lasted until past twelve, very
well. Then came dinner, at which neither he
nor Laurie displayed much of the exuberant spirit
that possessed their table companions. After
the meal Ned went over to the library for an
hour. When he returned to No. 16 he found
Laurie standing at the window that looked southward
toward the distant ball-field, dejection in
the droop of his shoulders. Ned felt very sorry
for the other just then, and he tried to find something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
to say but couldn’t, though he cleared his
throat twice and got as far as “Hm!” You
couldn’t see much of the baseball game from that
window. The diamond was at the far end of the
field, and a corner of the football stand hid most
of it. Laurie found a book and read, and Ned began
a letter to his father. Somehow the afternoon
wore away.</p>

<p>Kewpie burst in at a little before five, at once
triumphant and downcast. Hillman’s had won,
11 to 8, but Kewpie Proudtree had not been allowed
to pitch for even a part of an inning, and
so his last chance was gone, and if Pinky called
that doing the square thing— But Laurie broke
in just then. “Can it,” he said gruffly. “You
saw the game, anyhow, and that’s more than I
did!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Kewpie, apologetically.
“It’s a rotten shame, Nod. What’s Johnny got
on you, anyhow? You can tell me. I won’t say
a word.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got anything on me,” growled
Laurie. “He just thinks he has. Who pitched?”</p>

<p>“George started, but they got to him in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
fourth—no, fifth, and Nate finished out. Gee,
they were three runs ahead of us in the seventh!”</p>

<p>“Did Elk get in?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s got a sprained wrist or something.
Pinky had Simpson, of the scrubs, catch the last
of the ninth. He dropped everything that
reached his hands, though.”</p>

<p>“Elk’s got a sprained wrist, you say? How’d
he do it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe it isn’t a wrist. He’s
got something wrong, though, for I heard Dave
Brewster talking about it.” After a minute
Kewpie returned to his grievance, and, since
Laurie appeared busy with his own thoughts, he
was allowed to unburden himself to his heart’s
content. Ned condoled with him somewhat abstractedly.
When he had taken himself out
Laurie broke the silence.</p>

<p>“With Elk out of the game,” he said bitterly,
“I’d have had my chance to-day, and then this
had to happen!”</p>

<p>Ned might have reminded Laurie that he had
only himself to blame, but he didn’t. He only
said, “I’m sorry, old son.” There was sincerity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
in his tone, and Laurie heard it. He made no
answer, however. But later, at supper, their
feud was dead, and after supper, in the room,
they talked enough to make up for twenty-four
hours of silence. One subject, though, was not
mentioned.</p>

<p>Sunday morning the blow fell. There was another
visit to Dr. Hillman’s study. Both boys
were again questioned, but their answers did not
vary from those they had given on Saturday.
The Doctor showed genuine regret when he made
known the decision of the faculty. Laurie had
been exonerated from lack of evidence against
him, although it was apparent that the Doctor
considered him as deserving of punishment as
Ned. Ned was suspended. That meant that he
would not be passed in his examinations and
would have to return next year as a lower-middler
again. He might, as the Doctor reminded
him, study during the summer and so make the
upper-middle class during the fall term, however.
As the present term was so nearly at an end, the
Doctor continued, Ned would be permitted to remain
at school until Laurie was ready to accompany
him home. The Doctor ended the interview<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
with the suggestion that it would be a
manly act on the part of the twins to reimburse
Mr. Wells for the damage done to his car. Ned
opened his mouth as though to say something
then, but he changed his mind and closed it
again very tightly. A minute later they were
outside.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Ned, I’m sorry!” said Laurie miserably.</p>

<p>Ned nodded. “Thanks. It’s all right. One
of us had to get it.”</p>

<p>“One of us?” repeated Laurie a bit blankly.
“Why, yes, I suppose so, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got your baseball to look after,
and I haven’t anything. So it’s better they
picked on me, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We—ell,” began Laurie. Then he stopped
and shook his head in a puzzled way. Finally,
“You’ll stick around until Thursday, won’t
you?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The other nodded. “Might as well,” he said.
“I could get out now and wait for you in New
York, but I don’t see any reason why I should
spend all that money just to act haughty.”</p>

<p>The blow having fallen, Ned, who had already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
discounted it, cheered up quite remarkably. After
all, he told himself, he had saved Laurie, and
last autumn Laurie had saved him from something
very close to disgrace, and so this sacrifice
only somewhat evened accounts. He allowed
himself to be persuaded to accompany the others
on the Sunday afternoon walk, only pledging
Laurie to say nothing of his suspension. It was
not until Monday noon that the news leaked out,
and not until hours after that that the school began
to connect the incident of the wrecked automobile
with Ned’s fate. Even then most of those
who knew Ned intimately refused to believe that
there could be any connection between the two
things. Questioned, Ned was very uncommunicative,
and by Tuesday even his closest friends
began to waver in their faith.</p>

<p>Laurie went back to the baseball fold on Monday.
Kewpie’s report about Elk was true. Elk
was nursing a lame wrist. He had, it seemed,
hurt it in wrestling with his room-mate. It had
kept him out of the game Saturday, and it prevented
his doing any catching on Monday; but
on Tuesday the injured wrist appeared as good
as ever, and Laurie, who had been temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
elevated to the position of first substitute catcher,
again dropped into third place. The Farview
game was due on Wednesday, which was likewise
Class day and the final day of the school term.
On Monday Coach Mulford was very easy with
the first-string players but gave the substitutes
a hard afternoon’s work. Laurie caught four of
the five innings that the substitutes played
against the scrub team. In the final inning he
gave place to Simkins and took that youth’s
berth at first base. Tuesday saw the whole
squad hard at work in the final preparation for
the enemy, and no player, from Captain Dave
Brewster down to the least of the substitutes,
had a minute’s respite. “You fellows can rest
all you want to after to-morrow,” said the coach.
“You can spend all summer resting if you like.
To-day you’re going to work and work hard.”
Even Kewpie, who knew that Fate held nothing
for him, was subjected to almost cruel exertion.
He pitched to Laurie until his arm almost rebelled,
and he was made to “dummy pitch” from
the mound and then field the balls that Pinky
batted at him and to all sides of him. And he
ran bases, too, and Kewpie considered that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
final indignity and privately thought that the
least Pinky could do was to leave him in peace to
his sorrow. But before Tuesday’s practice began
other things of more importance to our
story happened. While dressing Tuesday morning
Laurie let fall a remark that led to the clearing
away of mistakes and misconceptions.</p>

<p>“You must have gone to bed with your clothes
on the other night,” he observed. “If you
didn’t, you sure made a record!”</p>

<p>Ned stared. “What other night?” he asked.</p>

<p>Laurie floundered. Neither of them had referred
to the matter since Sunday. “Why—well,
you know. The night you got in the window,”
Laurie explained apologetically.</p>

<p>“The night <em>I</em> got in the window! Are you
crazy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” muttered Laurie, “all right. I
didn’t mean to make you huffy.”</p>

<p>He went on with his dressing, but Ned still
stared at him. After a minute Ned asked:
“Look here, old son, what made you say that?
About me getting in the window, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing.” Laurie wanted peace in the
family. “Nothing at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>“You had some reason,” Ned persisted, “so
out with it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were so blamed quick, Ned.
You went to the door and then I heard you
get into bed about thirty seconds afterward.
It don’t seem to me that you had time to undress.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get this right,” said Ned with what was
evidently forced calm. “Sit down there a minute,
Laurie. Why do you say it was I who came
through the window?”</p>

<p>It was Laurie’s turn to stare. “Why, why
because I saw you! I waked up just as your head
came over the sill, you chump!”</p>

<p>“You saw <em>my</em> head come— Look here, are you
in earnest or just trying to be funny?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me it’s you who are acting
the silly ass,” answered Laurie aggrievedly.
“What’s the big idea, anyway?”</p>

<p>“But—but, great Scott, Laurie,” exclaimed
Ned excitedly. “I saw <em>you</em> come in the window!”</p>

<p>“Cut the comedy,” grinned Laurie. “I
wasn’t out, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, was I, you poor fish? Wasn’t I in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
bed and asleep when you came in, as you told
Johnny you did?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but— Say, do you mean to tell me I
didn’t see—”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t! But—”</p>

<p>“Then who <em>did</em> I see?” asked Laurie a trifle
wildly.</p>

<p>“Who did <em>I</em> see?” countered Ned. “You say
it wasn’t you—”</p>

<p>“Me! Hang it, I went to bed at ten and
wasn’t awake again until I heard a noise and
saw you—well some one coming in that window!
Look here, if it wasn’t you, why didn’t you tell
Johnny so?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought it was <em>you</em>, you poor
prune!”</p>

<p>“What! But I’d said—”</p>

<p>“Sure you had, but I’d seen you with my own
eyes, hadn’t I?”</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head weakly. “This is too
much for me,” he sighed. “It wasn’t you and
it wasn’t me but it was one of us! I pass!”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t one of us,” exclaimed Ned.
“That’s what I’m getting at. Don’t you see
what happened?” Laurie shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>“Listen, then. We were both asleep, and we
each heard the noise and woke up. Some one
came through the window, crossed the room,
opened the door, looked out to see that the coast
was clear, went out, and closed the door after
him.”</p>

<p>“But I heard you get into bed!”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t. You heard me sit up and
punch my pillow. I wanted you to know that you
weren’t getting away with it. For that matter
I heard your bed creak and thought you were
getting into it.”</p>

<p>“I sat up, too,” said Laurie. “Gee, that’s a
queer one! All this time I thought it was you
and could have kicked myself around the block
for yelling ‘No!’ when Johnny asked me that
question! Then—then who the dickens <em>was</em> it,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“That,” answered Ned grimly, “is what we’ve
got to find out. Just now it’s up to us to get
out of here before we miss our breakfasts!”</p>

<p>“Hang breakfast!” shouted Laurie. “This is
better than a hundred breakfasts! Why—why,
it means that you—that you aren’t suspended!
It means—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>“Put your collar on, and make it snappy,”
laughed Ned. “We’ve got some work ahead of
us this morning!”</p>

<p>After breakfast they hurried back to No. 16,
barred the door against intruders, especially
Kewpie, sat down at opposite sides of the study
table, and faced the problem. They continued
to face it until nearly eleven. They examined
the window-sill for clues, and found none. They
leaned out and studied the ivy by means of
which the mysterious visitor had reached the
second story, and it told them nothing, or so
it seemed at the moment. As they turned back
to the room Ned said idly: “It’s lucky the
fellow didn’t have to get to the third floor, for
I don’t believe he could have made it. That ivy
sort of peters out above our window.”</p>

<p>Laurie nodded uninterestedly and silence ensued,
just as silence had ensued so frequently
before in the course of morning. Then, several
minutes later, Ned said suddenly, questioningly:</p>

<p>“Thurston!”</p>

<p>Laurie shook his head. “Not likely. Besides,
what reason—”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I didn’t tell you. It didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
seem important. After I’d settled down again
that night I heard the floor up-stairs creak twice.
I wasn’t just certain then, but now I am! Elk
Thurston was moving about up there, Laurie!”</p>

<p>“Well, what if he was? That doesn’t
prove—” He stopped and frowned intently.
“Hold on, though, Ned! What about Elk’s
wrist?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got it!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe. Let’s go slow, though. You
don’t happen to know whether Elk can drive a
car, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll bet you anything you like that he
tried to drive that one! Look here, our window
was open and it was easy to reach. He couldn’t
have made his own without chancing a fall. He
trusted to our being asleep. He—”</p>

<p>“What about the other fellow, though?” asked
Laurie. “We didn’t see—”</p>

<p>“No, but maybe he got in first. Maybe it was
really he who awoke us. Come to think of it,
you said that when you woke up the fellow’s head
was just coming into sight. Well, in that case
there wouldn’t have been enough noise—”</p>

<p>“By jiminy, that’s so! Bet you that’s what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
happened. But who— Say, maybe the other fellow
was Jim Hallock!”</p>

<p>“Just what I was thinking,” agreed Ned. “I
don’t see, though, how we can prove anything
against either of them. Look here, son, I guess
the best thing we can do is see Johnny and tell
him all about it. After that it will be up to
the faculty. Come on!”</p>

<p>They had to wait some time for an audience,
but finally they were facing the Doctor, and Ned,
as spokesman, was saying very earnestly: “Neither
Laurie nor I was out of our room after ten
o’clock Friday night, sir. Somebody did come
in our window, though, and woke us up. I
thought it was Laurie and he thought it was me,
and that’s why I didn’t want to answer your
question, sir.”</p>

<p>Now, nothing could have been clearer and
simpler than that and yet, when Ned had finished,
the principal blinked behind his spectacles, gazed
a moment in silence, and then waved a hand.</p>

<p>“Sit down, boys,” he said. “Now, Edward I
think you’d better say that all over again.”</p>

<small>MR. GOUPIL CALLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After practice that afternoon Laurie returned
to the room to find Ned engaged in
sorting things out preparatory to packing up.
When Laurie entered, however, the other paused
in his effort to stuff more rubbish into an already
overloaded waste-basket and announced in triumph,
“We had it right, partner!”</p>

<p>“Elk Thurston?”</p>

<p>“Elk and Jim Hallock. Elk’s just left here.”</p>

<p>“Left here? You mean he was in to see you?”</p>

<p>Ned nodded. “Yes. It was rather decent of
him, I think. Take that idiotic expression from
your face and sit down. This is how Elk tells
it. He and Jim were looking out of their window
that night and saw the lights of Mr. Wells’s car
on the other side of the hedge. One of them said
something about Mr. Wells always leaving his
car around and what a joke it would be if it
wasn’t there when he came back for it. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
that idea sort of stuck, and after a while Elk
suggested that they sneak down and run the car
off around the corner. Elk says that Jim usually
wouldn’t have gone in for anything like that
on a bet, but there’d been some tough exams
that day, and Jim was sort of keyed up. Anyhow,
they sneaked down-stairs after a while and
got out by one of the windows in the recreation-room.
They didn’t dare try the front way, for
Cornish had his study door open. They put the
brakes off and tried to push the car toward
Washington Street, but it was heavy, and after
they’d got it a little ways they decided to start
it and run it around the corner. So they did,
pretty sure that it was too far off for Mr. Wells
to hear. Elk took the wheel and they went to
Washington Street. Then, he says, the thing
was working so pretty they thought they’d go
on further. When they got to where Washington
joins Walnut it was pretty dark, and he swung
to the right too soon.</p>

<p>“That’s when they hit the hydrant. Of
course, they were scared pink, and Elk shut the
motor off and they beat it as fast as they
could. When they got back here they found that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
some one had been prowling around and had
locked the window. Then they saw our windows
open and decided to climb up by the ivy. Elk
says they hoped we’d be asleep. If we waked up
they meant to tell us and ask us to keep mum.
Jim climbed up first and made it all right, but
Elk had hurt his wrist when the car struck the
hydrant, and he had a hard time of it. They
didn’t either of them know that Cornish had
seen them. For that matter, he only saw one,
I guess, and that one was probably Elk, for
he says it took him two or three minutes to get to
the window because his wrist hurt him so.
Seems that Jim left the hall door open after him,
but the draft closed it, and that’s what woke us
up, I guess. Well, what Elk came for was to say
that neither of them knew they’d been seen and
that they hadn’t meant to throw suspicion on us.
He says if they’d known that Cornish was prowling
around they wouldn’t have entered our
window. He was very particular about making
that clear. Guess he thought you might think he
had done it on purpose to get even with you.
And that’s that, old son.”</p>

<p>Laurie nodded thoughtfully. “Kind of too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
bad,” he mused. “I suppose they didn’t intend
anything but a sort of joke on Mr. Wells. Did
he tell you what they were going to get?”</p>

<p>“Get? Oh, they’re suspended, he says. He
seemed to feel worse about Jim than about himself.
Do you know, old son, after all Elk isn’t
such a bad sort. At least, that’s the way it
strikes me after hearing his spiel. He says he’s
not coming back next year. He’s going to tutor
this summer and try and make college in the
fall.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Laurie abstractedly. “Well,
I’m sort of sorry for him. And of course he
didn’t mean to get us in wrong.” He lapsed into
silence. Then, abruptly, “Cas Bennett split his
finger with a foul tip about half an hour ago,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“He did?” exclaimed Ned. “Gosh, that’s
tough luck! Will it keep him out of the game?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Laurie.</p>

<p>“That <em>is</em> tough! Say, what are you looking
so queer about?”</p>

<p>“Just thinking,” answered Laurie. “You try
it.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>“Use the old bean, son. Cas has split his
finger, Elk’s suspended—”</p>

<p>“Great jumpin’ Jehoshaphat! Why, then,
you—you—”</p>

<p>“Correct,” said Laurie. “I’ll have to catch
to-morrow, and—and at the present moment,
Ned, I’m scared to death!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That had been a day of events, and it was not
yet over. Attic Society was giving its usual end-of-the-term
blow-out that evening, and both Ned
and Laurie were invited. The affair began at
eight, and at half-past seven they were in No. 16
putting the finishing touches to their toilets. Although
it was a stag-party it called for best
clothes and polished shoes and carefully brushed
hair, and Laurie was trying hard to subdue a
rebellious lock on the crown of his head when
there came a knock on the door. Both boys
shouted “Come in!” simultaneously. Then the
door was opened, revealing Mr. Cornish, the hall
master, and a stranger. The boys grabbed for
their coats, Laurie dropping a military brush to
the floor with a disconcerting noise. Mr. Cornish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
ushered the stranger in but himself came no
further than the door-sill.</p>

<p>“Here is a gentleman to see you, Laurence,”
said the instructor. “I was quite certain you
were in, and so I brought him up.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cornish smiled, nodded to the guest, who
bowed impressively, and departed, closing the
door behind him.</p>

<p>“Very glad indeed—” began Laurie.</p>

<p>“Have a seat, won’t—” supplemented Ned.</p>

<p>“Thank you.” The stranger again bowed and
seated himself, placing a cane across his immaculately
clad legs and balancing a somewhat
square derby hat perilously atop. “I begin by
offering you my apologies for this intrusion,”
he continued.</p>

<p>“Not necessary,” mumbled Laurie, his gaze
busy with the guest. The latter appeared to be
about fifty, was under rather than over average
height, and was very broad and thick and, like
his derby, rather square of contour. He even
had a distinctly square face which began very
high up, because of the disappearance of what
hair may have adorned the front of his head at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
one time, and ended in an auxiliary chin. He
wore a very black mustache whose ends were
waxed to sharp points. His eyes were quite as
black and almost as sharp as his mustache. He
looked foreign, and, indeed spoke with more than
a trace of accent, but he was evidently a gentleman,
and he impressed the boys very favorably.</p>

<p>“With your permission,” he continued, “I will
introduce myself.” He regarded Laurie. “I
have the honor of addressing Mr. Laurie
Turner?” Laurie nodded. The guest carefully
secured hat and stick, arose, and bowed deeply.
“I,” he announced then, “am Mr. Goupil.”</p>

<p>For an instant silence ensued. Then, “Mister—I
beg your pardon,” said Laurie, “but did you
say <em>Goupil</em>?”</p>

<p>“Goupil,” confirmed the gentleman, bowing
again and smiling very nicely.</p>

<p>“You mean,” stammered Laurie, “<em>the</em> Mr.
Goupil? Of Sioux City? Miss Comfort’s Mr.
Goupil?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, then,” exclaimed Laurie, “I’m
mighty glad to meet you, sir.” He stepped forward
with outstretched hand, and Mr. Goupil enfolded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
it in a far more capacious one. “And
this is my brother Ned.” Mr. Goupil then
shook hands with the amazed Ned. After that
they all sat down. Mr. Goupil arranged stick
and hat with precision, cleared his throat, and
began:</p>

<p>“My dear sister-in-law has told me of your
most kind efforts in her behalf, and I have presented
myself to make explanation and to add my
expressions of gratitude.” Mr. Goupil spoke
rather deliberately and seemed to choose his
words with care. “That your telegram received
no response is a matter of extreme regret. Yet,
when I inform you that it never reached me, you
will, of a certainty, exonerate me from discourtesy,
Mr. Laurie.”</p>

<p>“Why, surely,” agreed Laurie eagerly. “We
had already found out that the telegram was delivered
to the wrong person, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Is it so? But doubtless!” Mr. Goupil
paused and nodded several times. “Allow
me, please, the explanation of certain ever-to-be-regretted
circumstances. You must know, then,
that after the death of my excellent and never-to-be-forgotten
wife I was plunged in sorrow. You,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
sir, have never lost a beloved wife—but, no, no,
of a certainty you have not!” Mr. Goupil
laughed at himself heartily before he went on.
“Very well. To pursue. In my sorrow I returned
to the country of my birth for a visit, to
France, to Moissac, where live many of my relations.
But, sir, one does not elude Sorrow by
crossing the ocean! No, no, it is here!” Mr.
Goupil struck himself twice on the chest. “Soon
I return, sir, yet in the brief period of my absence
the harm has been done!” He paused with
dramatic effect.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Ned sympathetically, yet puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, for although I am absent but five
months, yet when I return a so horrible deed has
been perpetrated in my name.”</p>

<p>“Indeed.” It was Laurie’s turn this time.
Mr. Goupil’s large countenance depicted the utmost
dejection, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>“In my absence,” he went on, brightening,
“my lawyer, in whose hands all my affairs of person
were left, learned of the terms of the will of
my late wife’s mother. The will says that at the
death of my late wife the property in this so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
quaint town occupied by my dear sister-in-law
shall revert. Thereupon, stupid that he was, my
lawyer proceeds to write to my sister-in-law to
that effect. The rest, sir, you know. Yet this
lamentable news reached me but three days ago!
‘What,’ asks this lawyer, ‘will you do with this
property in Orstead, New York?’</p>

<p>“‘What property do you speak of?’ I ask
him. He tells me then. I am overcome. I am
frantic. ‘Imbecile!’ I shout. ‘What have you
done?’ I come at once by the fastest of
trains. I am here!”</p>

<p>“That—that was very nice of you,” faltered
Laurie, keeping his eyes carefully away from
Ned.</p>

<p>“Nice! But what else to be done? For nothing
at all would I have had it so happen, and so
I hasten to make amends, to offer apologies to
my dear wife’s sister, to you, sir, to correct a
so great mistake!”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” assented Laurie hurriedly. “Of
course. But what I don’t understand is why
the letter that Miss Comfort wrote to you didn’t
reach you, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goupil made a gesture of despair. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
will explain it also. My dear sister-in-law made
a mistake of the address. I saw the letter. It
was wrong. I—but wait!” Mr. Goupil drew
forth a handsome card-case, selected of the contents,
and reached forward. Laurie took the
card and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noic">Chicago &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sioux City &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Des Moines</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">GOUPIL-MacHENRY COMPANY</span></p>

<p class="noic">Stocks &#160;&#160; Bonds &#160;&#160; Investments<br>
514–520 Burlington Bldg., Sioux City, Ia.</p>

<p class="noi">Members of the<br>
<span class="padleft2">Chicago Stock Exchange</span></p>
</div>

<p>“You see?” pursued Mr. Goupil. “My dear
sister-in-law made the mistake regrettable. She
addressed the letter to the ‘Goupil Machinery
Company.’ There is none.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Laurie, enlightened, as he passed
the engraved card to Ned. “This MacHenry is
your partner, sir?”</p>

<p>“Of a certainty. Adam MacHenry he is, a
gentleman of Scottish birth, but now, like me,
William Goupil, a citizen of the United States,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, but look here, Mr. Goupil. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
Comfort must have had your initials wrong, too,
then, for—”</p>

<p>“Ah, another misfortune! Attend, please.
My name is Alphonse Guillaume Goupil. Yes.
Very well. When I am in this country but a very
short time I find that Alphonse is the name of all
waiters in all hotels everywhere I go. I put
aside Alphonse then. I am Guillaume Goupil.
Then I become prosperous. I enter into business.
Many do not know how to pronounce my
first name, and that is not well. So I then spell
it the American way. To-day I am William Goupil,
American citizen!”</p>

<p>“That explains why the telegram didn’t get
to you,” said Laurie. “Well, the whole thing’s
been a sort of—of—”</p>

<p>“Sort of a comedy of errors,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>Mr. Goupil seized on the phrase with enthusiasm.
“Yes, yes, a comedy of errors! You’ll
say so! A comedy of errors of a certainty, beyond
a matter of a doubt! But now, at last, it
is <i lang="fr">finis</i>. All is satisfactorily arranged. You
shall hear. First, then, I offered my dear sister-in-law
a nice home in Sioux City, but no, she
must stay here where it has been her home and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
her people’s home for so long a time. Also”—Mr.
Goupil laughed enjoyably—“also, Mr. Laurie,
she fears the Indians! But at last it is arranged.
In the fall she will return to her house.
By then it will be a place worthy of the sister of
my dear and greatly lamented wife. To-morrow
I shall give orders, oh, many orders! You shall
see. It will be—” Mr. Goupil raised his eyes
ecstatically—“magnificent!”</p>

<p>“Well, that certainly is great,” said Laurie.
“I can’t tell you how pleased I—we both are,
Mr. Goupil.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goupil bowed again, but without arising,
and smiled his own pleasure. “I shall ask you
to believe, Mr. Laurie, that never did I suspect
that my dear sister-in-law was in any need of
assistance. But now I understand. It shall be
arranged. From now on—” He waved a hand
grandly. Words would have said far less.</p>

<p>He arose. Laurie arose. Ned arose. Mr.
Goupil bowed. Laurie and Ned bowed.</p>

<p>“Once more, Mr. Laurie, I thank you for your
kindness to my dear sister-in-law. I thank also
your so noble brother. I shall be in Orstead for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
several days and it will give me great pleasure
to see you again. We shall meet, yes?”</p>

<p>“Of a certainty,” answered Laurie, with no
thought of impertinence. “To-morrow, perhaps,
at Miss Comfort’s, sir. We are going
there in the morning to say good-by to her.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! Until the morning, then.” Mr.
Goupil bowed. Laurie bowed. Ned bowed.
Mr. Goupil placed his derby in place, gave it an
admonishing tap, smiled pleasantly once more,
and was gone.</p>

<p>Laurie closed the door after him and leaned
weakly against it.</p>

<p>“If anything else happens to-night,” he
sighed, “I’ll go batty!”</p>

<small>THE MARVELOUS CATCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Wednesday afternoon, and the hands
of the clock in the tower of the Congregational
Church, seen distantly over the tops
of the trees, pointed to eighteen minutes before
three.</p>

<p>Ideal weather for Class day, hot in the sun,
pleasantly warm in the shade, with a very blue
sky trimmed around the edges with puffs of
creamy-white clouds. An ideal day, too, for the
big game, with plenty of heat to make muscles
responsive and no wind to deflect the ball from
its long, arching course. Kind, as well, to the
wearers of pretty, light dresses, with whom the
stands were liberally sprinkled, mothers, sisters,
cousins and aunts of the important-looking graduates.
Dark-blue pennants and pennants of
maroon and white drooped against their staffs
save when a moment of frenzy set them swirling
above the sloping stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span></p>

<p>The game was three innings old, and the black
score-board behind the back-stop held six big
round naughts. Those three innings had not
been devoid of interest, however, even if neither
team had tallied. Nervousness and over-anxiety
had filled at least two of them with breathless
moments. In the first and second Farview had
placed men on bases; in the second Hillman’s had
got Pat Browne as far as third. There had been
errors by both sides, and more than one case
of poor judgment. Nate Beedle, pitching for the
home team, and Luders, for the visitors, had been
in hot water much of the time. Yet each had
survived, and now, at the beginning of the fourth
inning, with Farview coming to bat, the game
was still to be won or lost.</p>

<p>Laurie had been through some bad moments.
For the first two innings he and Nate had not
worked together very smoothly. They had had
a half-hour of practice before an early dinner,
during which Nate had coached the new catcher
and Laurie had mastered signals. Later, Cas
Bennett had given Laurie the “dope” on the
Farview batters. He was still giving it between
innings, for Laurie’s mind was in no condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
to memorize. By the beginning of the third inning
ten Farview players had come to the plate,
and at least ten times Nate had refused Laurie’s
signal. Of course Laurie had known that Nate
was right and that he was wrong, but it had
all been mighty confusing and disconcerting.
Added to that was the continuing dread of throwing
badly to second. He could peg the ball to
first unerringly enough, or to third, but the long
heave across the width of the diamond terrorized
him. Once when he should have thrown to Lew
Cooper that fear of misfortune held his hand,
and Hillman’s had groaned as a Farview runner
slid unchallenged to the bag. Save for that occasion
a throw to second had not been called for,
and the test was still ahead of him. For the
rest, Laurie had done well enough. He had
dropped the delivery more times than he cared
to recall, but had escaped without penalty. Once
the ball had got past him entirely and bounded
against the back-stop, but, fortunately, the bases
had been empty. During the first of the third he
and Nate had come to understand each other
better, and constant reiteration by Cas had
finally impressed Laurie with the foibles of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
enemy batsmen. Now, at the beginning of the
fourth, he breathed easier and found himself sustained
by a measure of confidence. His throw
to second, before the first of the enemy stepped
into the box, was straight, hard, and knee-high.</p>

<p>Farview began with a scratch hit to the left field
that took an unexpected bound away from Frank
Brattle’s ready glove. Followed a screaming
two-bagger that placed the first runner on third.
Only a smart throw-in by Lee Murdock prevented
a tally then and there. The tally came
later, however, and a second followed close behind
it. Nate passed a batter and filled the
bases. Then a pretty sacrifice fly to short right
moved the runners up, and Farview cheered her
first score. Nate struck out the subsequent batter.
Then came a rolling grounder to Cooper
and Lew scraped it up and, with all the time in
the world, threw low to first. By the time Tom
Pope had turned around about three times looking
for the ball that he had stopped but not
caught, the runner on third had scored, the batsman
was safe, and the chap from second was
half-way between third and the plate. Tom shot
the ball home; Laurie got it, held it, and swung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
downward. There was an instant’s confusion of
dust and sound, and the umpire swung his mask
upward and out.</p>

<p>Two runs for Farview.</p>

<p>Farview clung to that lead until the sixth, but
could not add to it. In her half of the fourth
Hillman’s got Captain Dave as far as second, but
Murdock’s fly to left made the third out. In
the fifth the opposing pitcher struck out Laurie
and Nate and kindly allowed Cooper to pop a fly
to third baseman.</p>

<p>In the sixth things began to happen, all at
once and on all sides. Farview started the
trouble by hitting through short-stop for a base.
Nate pitched ten deliveries before the next batsman
at last fouled out to first baseman. Then
came an attempted sacrifice. The batsman laid
down the ball scarcely two feet from the plate,
and the runner on first was off. Laurie dashed
his mask aside, scooped up the trickling sphere,
stepped forward, and sped it to second. The
throw was perfect, and Pope got the runner.
Hillman’s applauded delightedly, and from the
Blue’s bench came the approving voice of the
coach, “Good work, Turner!” Laurie, accepting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
his mask from a Farview batsman, reflected that
maybe nothing was nearly as bad as you pictured
it beforehand, and remembered with surprise
that in making the throw he had not consciously
thought a thing about it; hadn’t hoped
he would make it or feared that he wouldn’t;
had simply picked up the ball and plugged it
across the diamond! Exit the bugaboo!</p>

<p>With two down, however, Farview refused to
yield the inning. Instead, she poked a hit across
second base and another past third and so added
another tally. That seemed to distress Nate
Beedle unnecessarily, and he proceeded to pass
the next batsman. And after that, with two
gone and two strikes and one ball on the succeeding
aspirant, he pitched three more balls in succession
and passed him, too! Very suddenly the
bases were full, and the game seemed about to
go glimmering. And at that moment George
Pemberton and the scrub catcher strode off
around the first base stand, and if the visiting
crowd hadn’t been making such a ridiculous
noise the thud of ball against mitten might have
been heard from back there.</p>

<p>Nate was, in baseball parlance, “as high as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
kite.” His first effort against the new batsman
was a ball that Laurie only stopped by leaping
two feet from the ground. Laurie walked half-way
to the pitcher’s box, amid the exultant howls
of a joyous foe, shook the ball in Nate’s face, and
savagely told him to take his time. Laurie was
angry just then. Nate was snappy and told
Laurie to “go on back and quit beefing! I’ll get
him!” Laurie signaled for a high ball; the batter
“ate up” low ones. Nate hesitated, shook
his head. Laurie called for one close in then.
Nate wound up and stepped forward. The result
was a wide one that made the score two balls
and no strikes. On the bench Mr. Mulford was
watching with sharp eyes. Nate followed with a
fast ball that was struck at too late. Laurie’s
heart retreated down his throat again. Once
more he signaled a high one. This time Nate
made no demur, but the ball failed to go over.
A substitute detached himself from the group on
the bench and sped around the stand. Laurie,
holding the ball, glanced toward the coach. He
got the expected sign. Nate, too, saw, and began
to pull at his glove. Captain Dave joined
him at the mound. Nate looked gloomy and mutinous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
Then George Pemberton came into sight,
paused an instant at the bench, and strode toward
the box.</p>

<p>Hillman’s cheered and Farview jeered. Nate
went to the bench with hanging head. As he
tossed the ball to the relief pitcher Laurie saw
Mr. Mulford pull Nate to a seat beside him and
put a big arm over the sorrowful one’s shoulders.
Then George Pemberton was pitching his
warm-up balls, and Laurie was devoutly hoping
that they weren’t samples of what he would offer
later. They were, but Laurie didn’t know
it then, for, with three balls and but one strike
on him, the over-eager Farview third baseman
struck at George’s first offering and got it. The
bases emptied, and red legs streaked for the
plate. But far out in deep center field Lee Murdock
cast one last look over his shoulder, turned,
and pulled down the fly, and Hillman’s let loose
with a sound that was half a groan of relief and
half a yell of joy!</p>

<p>With the score 3 to 0 against her, Hillman’s
pulled up even in the last of the sixth. Craig
Jones worked a pass; Tom Pope sacrificed him
neatly to second; and Captain Dave, functioning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
perfectly at last in the rôle of clean-up batter,
hit for two bases, and both Cooper and Jones
scored. Pat Browne was safe on a fielder’s
choice, Dave going out at third. Brattle hit
safely, and Murdock was passed. The bags were
all occupied, and the home team’s cohorts roared
exultantly and waved blue banners in air. And
Laurie came to bat.</p>

<p>I’d like immensely to tell how Laurie knocked
a home run or even a single, but truth compels
me to state that he did nothing of the sort. He
swung twice at good ones and missed them, and
ended by swinging a third time at a very poor
one. It remained for Pemberton to deliver the
hit and, perhaps because he was a proverbially
poor batter and wasn’t feared one bit by Mr.
Luders, he selected the second delivery and
jabbed it straight at the young gentleman’s head.
Luders put up a defensive hand. The ball tipped
it and bounded toward second. Three players
ran for it. By the time short-stop had got
it, Pemberton was galloping up to first, and Pat
Browne had slid in a cloud of dust across the
plate. A moment later Brattle was caught off
second, and the trouble was over for the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p>The seventh began with the score 3 to 3, but it
wouldn’t have remained there long if George
Pemberton had been allowed to pitch the inning
through. George was even wilder than he had
indicated. He couldn’t find the plate at all.
Four successive balls put a Farview batter on
first. One strike, a foul back of the plate that
Laurie missed by inches only, and four more
balls put another runner on bases. Laurie
begged, counseled, threatened. George nodded
agreeably and still sent them in anywhere but at
the expected spot. When he had pitched one
strike and two balls to the third man up, Coach
Mulford gave the “high sign” and George, not
at all regretfully, it seemed, dropped the ball
and gave way to Orville Croft.</p>

<p>Somehow Croft came through unpunished.
There were no more passes, for Croft put the
ball over the base nicely, but there were so many
near-hits that Laurie’s heart was in his mouth almost
every minute. If the Hillman’s fielders
hadn’t worked like a set of young professionals
in that inning awful things would certainly have
befallen the Blue. The infield showed real ball
playing, and thrice what seemed a safe hit was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
spoiled. Farview got the first of her runners to
third, but he finally died there when Captain
Dave dived to the base-line and scooped up a
ball that was on its way to deep left.</p>

<p>For Hillman’s the last of the seventh made
good its reputation. It was the lucky seventh,
and no mistake about it. Luck put Cooper on
first when Luders slanted a slow curve against
his ribs, and luck decreed that the red-legged
short-stop should drop the ball a minute later
when Cooper took advantage of Jones’s slam to
third. Perhaps luck had something to do with
the pass handed to Pope, too, but it certainly
didn’t altogether govern Captain Dave’s second
long hit that sent in Cooper and Jones and put
Hillman’s in a veritable seventh heaven—I almost
wrote “inning”—of delight!</p>

<p>That hit ended Luders’s usefulness. He issued
another pass, got himself into a hole with Frank
Brattle, and was derricked, a sandy-haired youth
named Clay succeeding him. Clay disposed of
Brattle very neatly, Murdock flied out to short-stop,
and again Laurie failed to deliver the hit
that was, he felt certain, somewhere inside him.
Laurie brought the lucky seventh to a close by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
knocking a weak grounder to first baseman.</p>

<p>Hillman’s visioned victory and was joyous and
noisy when the eighth began, but after the first
Farview batsman had lined out Croft’s first offering
for two bases the joy paled and the noise
noticeably subsided. And when the next red-legged
batter had hit for a single it began to
dawn on the Hillman’s supporters that possibly
the old adage to the effect that he who laughs
last laughs best might be true. Hillman’s pitching
staff was exhausted, and if Croft went the
way of Beedle and Pemberton—and he gave
every indication of doing so—the only way the
Blue would get the game would be as a gift from
Farview! The Maroon and White took to Croft
as a duck takes to water. He didn’t have much
except a couple of slow curves. His fast one
wasn’t exceptionally fast, and it generally failed
to locate the plate. Those slow curves pleased
the Farview batsmen immensely. Even the tail-end
of their list found no trouble in hitting them.
Laurie, watching the man on first as a cat watches
a mouse, saw more than a runner who might
steal second; he saw a victory fading into defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<p>Croft worked two strikes on the next man, and
then again came the dread sound of wood against
leather. This time, though, the ball arched high
and Cooper, racing back, got under it, and there
was one down. The runner on third had no
chance to score, or thought so. Then, when Captain
Dave had talked briefly but earnestly to
Croft, that youth promptly issued one more base
on balls, and the sacks were filled, and defeat
loomed large on the horizon. One down, the
bases full, and Croft going the way of the others!
Laurie’s gaze wondered to the bench and Coach
Mulford. And then, since to have looked at the
bench at all without seeing it would have been
impossible, he glimpsed the round, anxious, earnest
countenance of Kewpie Proudtree. Laurie’s
heart jumped out of place for possibly the twentieth
time that afternoon, and he called to Captain
Dave.</p>

<p>The game was held up while captain and
catcher conferred. Finally Dave hurried across
and hailed the coach. Another conference followed,
while Farview clamored for the contest
to go on. Then Mr. Mulford waved his hand at
Croft, and Kewpie, very much surprised but apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
not at all overwhelmed, walked into the
diamond, pulling on his glove.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silent amazement.
Then Farview went delirious with delighted
amusement. The Farview stand almost rocked
with the laughter that emanated from it,
laughter that came as a relief to strained nerves
and was indulged in freely. Hillman’s, recovering
from its first instant of amazement, cheered
valiantly, and, cheering, took hope. After all,
it might well be that the chubby Proudtree would
prove no worse than Croft. It was even possible
that he might be an improvement on that
youth. Meanwhile Farview laughed until tears
came and Laurie and Kewpie met midway of
mound and plate.</p>

<p>“Go slow, Kewpie,” said Laurie, “and follow
the signals. Take all the time you can; hear?
Waiting may worry them. Keep your nerve,
son, no matter what happens. Just pretend that
you’re pitching to me in practice.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Kewpie complacently. “Don’t
worry about me, Nod. Let’s go!”</p>

<p>One down and three on, a hit meaning two
runs! It was a tough situation that Kewpie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
faced. But Kewpie seemed totally unworried.
Laurie saw and marveled. His own heart was
thumping inside him like a small sledge-hammer.
He wondered if Kewpie was faking that unconcern
and would presently go to pieces like the
others, letting in an avalanche of runs!</p>

<p>But Kewpie was right. Laurie needn’t have
worried about him. Kewpie was magnificent, if
a boy of Kewpie’s size and proportions can ever
be magnificent! He was as slow as cold molasses,
yes, and his delivery elicited more amusement
from the enemy, but he struck out with apparent
ease the first batsman who faced him, caused
the next man to foul out to Captain Dave, and
fanned the third!</p>

<p>When that last of the enemy waved through
empty air and then cast his bat from him venomously,
Hillman’s loved Kewpie Proudtree with
a deep and fervid passion. Hillman’s said so.
Hillman’s rose from stand and greensward and
cheered his name to the blue afternoon sky and
howled and yelled and went crazy generally. And
Kewpie moved smilingly back to the bench to submit
to the hugs of his companions.</p>

<p>There was no scoring for the Blue in the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
of the eighth, for Clay was master of the situation.</p>

<p>Then Farview started her half of the ninth with
desperation written large on every countenance.
Kewpie, the unhurried, returned to his job. He
disposed of the Farview pitcher with four deliveries
and then faced the head of the list. That
he would survive that inning without misadventure
was too much to hope for. The misadventure
came when the Farview center fielder
slammed a ball into left field and got two bases.
Kewpie looked, or so Laurie though, a little surprised
and a little grieved, but he didn’t allow
his emotions to affect his pitching. He fooled
the next man twice with his out-drop and finally
finished him with a slow ball that the batter
struck at too soon. Hillman’s shouted, waved,
and prepared to go home.</p>

<p>But the end was not yet. Up came the Farview
captain, and he made it plain to Laurie at
once that he wasn’t to be caught with trifles.
He demanded good ones. If he didn’t get them
he wouldn’t swing. He didn’t say all this in
words, of course, but he looked it and showed it
by calmly watching Kewpie’s first offering drop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
by him, a scant inch beyond the outer corner of
the plate. In the end, he had his way. There
was something that suited him, and he accepted
it and drove it down third base line, scoring the
man on second and placing himself on third when
the throw went to the plate. Those who had
wandered toward the exits reconsidered and
stayed their steps. With a runner on third the
score might yet be tied.</p>

<p>The Farview right fielder had not yet made a
hit, but that to Laurie’s thinking made him the
more dangerous, and Laurie worked very carefully.
Kewpie answered the first signal with a
straight one over the center of the plate, and
it went for a strike. The next was also over the
center, but too high. Then again Kewpie failed.
One and two now. The runner on third was
dashing up and down the path, and the
coachers were yipping like mad. Kewpie, however
remained surprisingly calm. To show how
calm he was he sent in a drop that scored a second
strike for him, and the blue pennants waved
triumphantly. Laurie called for the same thing
again, but this time the batter did not offer at it;
the score was two and three, and Laurie’s heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
sank. The next must be good. He placed his
hands out and called imploringly:</p>

<p>“Right into the old mitt, Kewpie! Make it
good!”</p>

<p>And Kewpie made it good, and, since it was
good, unmistakably good, the Farview youth
swung against it with all his might.</p>

<p>But he hit under it, and the ball went up and
up in the sunlight almost straight above the
plate. Cries arose from all sides, a confusing
bedlam of warning, entreaty, command. Laurie
dashed his mask behind him, stared upward into
the blue, saw the gray sphere poised overhead,
turned and stepped back, looked again, again retreated.
He was under it now—almost. One
step further toward the back-stop—</p>

<p>Then Nemesis took a hand, or sought to.
Laurie’s backward placed foot found the discarded
mask. He strove to retain his balance
but could not and fell backward to the ground.
The mask described a curve and landed yards
away. Laurie’s feet flew heavenward. His
hands were stretched wide. Then his startled
gaze saw a new danger. Right above him was
the ball, falling straight for his face. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
save pure instinct, the instinct that causes one to
fend off a blow, brought his hands up before him.
It was, however, not so much instinct as baseball
training that brought them there palms upward.
And, beyond any doubt, it was training that
caused his fingers to close convulsively about the
round object that landed with a loud smack in
the hollow of his old brown mitten!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Graduation Ball was over, and as the twins
walked homeward with Polly and Mae twelve
o’clock struck from the tower of the Congregational
Church across the park. There was a big
round moon riding high in the heavens, and the
June night was warm and scented. Mae was to
spend the night with Polly, and so the four kept
together across Walnut Street and past the Starling
house where, on the second floor, one lighted
window proclaimed the presence of Bob. Even
as Ned proposed a discreet hail, the light behind
the shade went out.</p>

<p>“It was a lovely dance, wasn’t it?” asked
Polly. Laurie, beside her, assented. “It’s
been a perfectly gorgeous day,” added Polly.
“All of it. It was such fun this morning at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
Miss Comfort’s. And that Mr. Goupil is a darling
duck, isn’t he? And, oh, won’t it be perfectly
corking next fall, Laurie, when we have
the boat for our own? Think of the good times
we can have! It was wonderful of Miss Comfort
to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Bet you anything,” chuckled Laurie, “she’ll
wish herself back there. Dare say she won’t be
able to sleep on shore again after a summer on
the rolling deep!”</p>

<p>Polly laughed. “She’s a dear, isn’t she?
And, Laurie, didn’t everything turn out beautifully
this spring? Think how we ‘reclaimed’
Kewpie and—”</p>

<p>“Heard Kewpie’s latest? He told Ned and
me before supper that he might not be able to
play football next fall because he didn’t want to
risk hurting his pitching arm! He’s a rare bird,
that Kewpie!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he must play football! But he will, of
course. Wasn’t he splendid this afternoon?
And—and weren’t you splendid, too? I just
shrieked and shrieked when you made that perfectly
wonderful catch and saved the game!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t save the game,” answered Laurie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
“I dare say that fellow would have struck out in
another minute. Anyhow, Kewpie says he would
have!”</p>

<p>“But Kewpie doesn’t know, and if he had made
a hit it would have tied the score at least. Anyhow,
your catch was absolutely marvelous. Every
one says so.”</p>

<p>A short silence followed. Then Laurie said resolutely:
“Look here, I guess you might as
well know the truth about that, Polly. I didn’t
really make that catch.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean? I saw you make
it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but—well you see, I didn’t
<em>intend</em> to do it. I saw that ball coming down
straight for the end of my nose, and I just put
my hands up to ward it off. Of course every one
thinks I’m a regular wonder, but I’m not. It
was just an accident. I—I haven’t told any one
but Ned—and you.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t spoil it a bit,” declared Polly.
“You did catch the ball, didn’t you? And if
you’d just been trying to keep it from hitting
you you wouldn’t have really caught it, would
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what Ned said,” mused Laurie.
“Hanged if I know!”</p>

<p>“Ned’s perfectly right,” responded Polly emphatically.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” said Ned as he and Mae
joined them before the door of the little shop.
“But what is it this time?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Polly. “You can ask
Laurie.”</p>

<p>“He probably won’t tell me,” said Ned
gloomily. “He hates to say I’m right about
anything. Gee, Polly, it seems funny to think
that I won’t see this place again for three
months.”</p>

<p>“It’s horrid,” answered Polly, and Mae murmured
agreement. “Still, I suppose three
months won’t seem <em>awfully</em> long. And you <em>will</em>
write, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly will,” asserted Ned. “And don’t
you forget to. But we’ll see you both in the
morning. We don’t get away until eleven
twenty-two. Thanks for coming to the dance.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for asking us,” said Polly, her hand
on the door. “Good night. Good night, Laurie.
We’ve had a lovely time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span></p>

<p>“Same here,” said Laurie as he tugged at
Ned’s sleeve.</p>

<p>Ned joined him at the edge of the sidewalk,
and they took their caps off and bowed in the
manner of Mr. Goupil.</p>
